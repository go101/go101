<h1>Channels In Go</h1>

<p>
Channel is an important built-in feature in Go.
It is one of the features that make Go unique.
Along with another unique feature, goroutine, the two unique features
make concurrent programming in Go become very convenient and fun.
And the two features lower the difficulties of concurrent programming much.
</p>

<p>
This article will list all the channel related concepts, syntaxes and rules.
To understand channels better, the internal structure of channels and some
implementation details by the standard Go compiler/runtime are also simply described.
</p>

<h3>Concurrent Programming And Concurrency Synchronization</h3>

<div>
<p>
Modern CPUs often have multiple cores, and some CPU cores support hyper-threading.
In other words, modern CPUs can process multiple instruction pipelines simultaneously.
To fully use the power of modern CPUs,
we need to do concurrent programming in coding our programs.
</p>

<p>
Concurrent computing is a form of computing in which
several computations are executed during overlapping time periods.
The following picture depicts two concurrent computing cases.
In the picture, A and B represent two separate computations.
The second case is also called parallel computing,
which is special concurrent computing.
In the first case, A and B are only in parallel during a small piece of time.
<br/>
<img src="res/concurrent-vs-parallel.png">
<br/>
</p>

<p>
Concurrent computing may happen in a program, a computer, or a network.
In Go 101, we only talk about program-scope concurrent computing.
Goroutine, which <a href="control-flows-more.html">has been introduced before</a>,
is the Go way to create concurrent computations.
</p>

Concurrent computations may share resources, generally memory resource.
There are some circumstances may happen in a concurrent computing.
<ul>
<li>
	In the same period of one computation is writing data to a memory segment,
	another computation is reading data from the same memory segment.
	Then the integrity of the data read by the other computation might be not preserved.
</li>
<li>
	In the same period of one computation is writing data to a memory segment,
	another computation is also writing data to the same memory segment.
	Then the integrity of the data stored at the memory segment might be not preserved.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
These circumstances are called data races. One of the duties in concurrent
programming is to control resource sharing among concurrent computations,
so that data races will not happen.
The ways to achieve this duty are called concurrency synchronization,
or data synchronization.
Go supports several data synchronization techniques.
Below will introduce one of them, channel.
</p>

Other duties in concurrent programming include
<ul>
<li>
	determine how many computations are needed.
</li>
<li>
	determine when to start and end a computation.
</li>
<li>
	determine how to distribute workload among concurrent computations.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most operations in Go are not synchronized, in other words,
they are not thread-safe.
These operations include value assignments, argument passing and
container element manipulations, etc.
There are only a few operations which are synchronized,
including the several to be introduced channel operations below.
</p>

<p>
In Go, generally, each computation is a goroutine.
So later we use goroutines to represent computations.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Channel Introduction</h3>

<p>
One suggestion (made by <i>Rob Pike</i>) for concurrent programming is
<b>don't (let goroutines) communicate by sharing memory,
(let them) share memory by communicating (through channels)</b>.
The channel mechanism is a result of this philosophy.
</p>

<p>
Communicating by sharing memory and sharing memory by communicating
are two patterns in concurrent programming.
When goroutines communicate by sharing memory, we need use some
tranditional concurrency synchronization techniques, such as mutex locks,
to protect the shared memory to prevent data races.
</p>

<p>
Go provides a unique concurrency synchronization technique, channel.
Channels make goroutines share memory by communicating.
We can view a channel as an internal FIFO (first in, first out) data queue
within a program. Some goroutines send values to the queue (the channel)
and some other goroutines receive values from the queue.
<p>

<p>
Along with transferring values (through channels),
the ownerships of some values may be also transferred between goroutines.
When a goroutine sends a value to a channel,
we can view the goroutine releases the ownerships of some values.
When a goroutine receives a value from a channel,
we can view the goroutine acquires the owerships of some values.
The values (whose owerships are transferred) are often referenced
(but are not required to be referenced) by the transferred value.
</p>

<p>
Surely, there may be also not any ownerships transferred
along with channel communications.
</p>

<p>
Please note, here, when we talk about ownerships,
we mean the ownerships from the logic view.
Not like Rust language, Go doesn't assure value ownerships from the syntax level.
Go channels can help programmers write data races free code easily,
but Go channels don't prevent programmers from writing bad concurrent code.
</p>

<p>
Although Go also supports tranditional concurrency synchronization techniques.
only channel is first-level citizen in Go. Channel is one kind of types in Go,
so we can use channels without importing any packages.
On the other hand,
<a href="concurrent-synchronization-overview.html">those
tranditional concurrency synchronization techniques</a> are provided
in the <code>sync</code> and <code>sync/atomic</code> standard packages.
</p>

<p>
Honestly, each concurrency synchronization technique
has its own best use scenarios.
But channel has <a href="channel-use-cases.html">a wider application range
and has more variety in using</a>.
One problem of channels is, the experience of programming with channels is
so enjoyable and fun that programmers often even prefer to use channels for
the scenarios which channels are not best for.
</p>

<h3>Channel Types And Values</h3>

<div>
<p>
Channel types are composite types. Like array, slice and map,
each channel type has an element type.
All data to be sent to the channel must be values of the element type.
</p>

Channel types can be bi-directional or single-directional.
Assume <code>T</code> is an arbitrary type,
<ul>
<li>
	<code>chan T</code> denotes a bidirectional channel type.
	Compilers allow both receiving values from and sending values to
	bidirectional channels.
</li>
<li>
	<code>chan&lt;- T</code> denotes a send-only channel type.
	Compilers don't allow receiving values from send-only channels.
</li>
<li>
	<code>&lt;-chan T</code> denotes a receive-only channel type.
	Compilers dsn't allow sending values to receive-only channels.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<code>T</code> is called element types of these channel types.
</p>

<p>
Values of bidirectional channel type <code>chan T</code> can be converted to
both send-only type <code>chan&lt;- T</code> and
receive-only type <code>&lt;-chan T</code>, but not vice versa.
Values of send-only type <code>chan&lt;- T</code> can't be converted to
receive-only type <code>&lt;-chan T</code>, and vice versa.
Note that the <code>&lt;-</code> signs in channel type literals are modifiers.
</p>

<p>
Each channel has a capacity, which will be explained in the section after next.
A channel with a zero capacity is called unbuffered channel and
a channel with a non-zero capacity is called buffered channel.
</p>

<p>
The zero values of channel types are represented with
the predeclared identifier <code>nil</code>.
A non-nil channel value must be created by using the built-in <code>make</code>
function. For example, <code>make(chan int, 10)</code> will create a channel
whose element type is <code>int</code>.
The second argument of the <code>make</code> function call specifies
the capacity of the new created channel.
The second parameter is optional and its default value is zero.
</p>

</div>

<p class="anchor" id="assign-and-compare"></p>
<h3>Channel Assignments And Comparisons</h3>

<p>
All channel types are comparable types.
</p>

<p>
From the article <a href="value-part.html">value parts</a>,
we know that non-nil channel values are multi-part values.
After one channel value is assigned to another,
the two channels share the same undrelying part(s).
In other words, the two channels represent the same internal channel object.
The result of comparing them is <code>true</code>.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="operations"></p>
<h3>Channel Operations</h3>

<div>
<p>
There are five operations we can perform on a channel.
Assume the channel is <code>ch</code>,
their syntaxes and function calls of these operations are listed here.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
	Close the channel by using the following function call
<pre><code class="language-go">close(ch)
</code></pre>
	<p>
	where <code>close</code> is a built-in function.
	The argument of a <code>close</code> function call must be a channel value,
	and the channel value must not be a receive-only channel.
	</p>
</li>
<li>
	Send a value, <code>v</code>, to the channel
	by using the following syntax
<pre><code class="language-go">ch &lt;- v
</code></pre>
	<p>
	where <code>v</code> must be a value which is assignable to
	the element type of channel <code>ch</code>.
	Note that here <code>&lt;-</code> is a channel-send operator.
	</p>
</li>
<li>
	Receive a value from the channel by using the following syntax
<pre><code class="language-go">&lt;-ch
</code></pre>
	A channel receive operation always returns at least one result,
	which is a value of the element type of the channel.
	Note that here <code>&lt;-</code> is a channel-receive operator.
	(Its representation is the same as a channel-send operator.)

	<p>
	</p>

	For most scenarios, a channel receive operation is viewed as
	a single-valued expression.
	However, when a channel operation is used as the only source value
	expression in an assignment, it can be viewed as a multi-valued
	expression and result a second optional untyped boolean value,
	which indicates whether or not the first result is sent
	before the channel is closed.
	(Below we will learn that we can receive unlimited number of values
	from a closed channel.)
	For example,
<pre><code class="language-go">v = &lt;-ch
v, sentBeforeClosed = &lt;-ch
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
	Query the value buffer capacity of the channel
	by using the following function call
<pre><code class="language-go">cap(ch)
</code></pre>
	<p>
	where <code>cap</code> is a built-in function which has ever been
	introduced in <a href="container.html#cap-len">containers in Go</a>.
	The return result of a <code>cap</code> function call
	is an <code>int</code> value.
	</p>
</li>
<li>
	Query the current number of values in the value buffer
	(or the length)
	of the channel by using the following function call
<pre><code class="language-go">len(ch)
</code></pre>
	<p>
	where <code>len</code> is a built-in function
	which also has ever been introduced before.
	The return value of a <code>len</code> function call
	is an <code>int</code> value.
	The result length is number of elements which have already
	been sent successfully to the queried channel
	but haven't been received (taken out) yet.
	</p>
</li>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
All these operations are already synchronized,
so no further synchronizations are needed to perform these operations.
However, like most other operations in Go,
channel value assignments are not synchronized.
Similarly, assigning the received value to another value is also
not synchronized, though any channel receive operation is synchronized.
</p>

<p>
If the queried channel is a nil channel, both of the
built-in <code>cap</code> and <code>len</code> functions return zero.
The two query operations are so simple that
they will not get further explanations later.
In fact, the two operations are seldom used in practice.
</p>

<p>
The rules for channel send, receive and close operations will be
introduced and explained in the following sections.
</p>

</div>

<p class="anchor" id="simple-rule-summary"></p>
<h3>A Simple Summary Of Channel Operation Rules</h3>

<div>
To make the explanations for channel operation rules simple and clear,
in the remaining of this article,
channels will be classified into three categories:
<ol>
<li>
	nil channels.
</li>
<li>
	non-nil but closed channels.
</li>
<li>
	not-closed non-nil channels.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The following a table simply describes the rules for all kinds of operations
applying on nil, closed and not-closed non-nil channels.
More detailed explanations will made in
<a href="#full-rule-explanations">a later section</a>.
</p>

<table class="table table-bordered text-center" style="width: auto !important;">
<thead>
	<tr class="active">
	<th class="text-center">Operation</th>
	<th class="text-center">A Nil Channel</th>
	<th class="text-center">A Closed Channel</th>
	<th class="text-center">A Not-Closed Non-Nil Channel</th>
	</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
	<tr>
	<th scope="row" class="text-center">Close</th>
	<td>panic</td>
	<td>panic</td>
	<td>succeed to close <sup>(C)</sup></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<th scope="row" class="text-center">Send Value To</th>
	<td>block for ever</td>
	<td>panic</td>
	<td>block or succeed to send <sup>(B)</sup></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<th scope="row" class="text-center">Receive Value From</th>
	<td>block for ever</td>
	<td>never block <sup>(D)</sup></td>
	<td>block or succeed to receive <sup>(A)</sup></td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

For the five unlabelled cases, the rules are very clear.
<ul>
<li>
	Closing a nil or a already closed channel
	produces a panic in the current goroutine.
</li>
<li>
	Sending a value to a closed channel also
	produces a panic in the current goroutine.
</li>
<li>
	Sending a value to or receiving a value from a nil channel makes
	the current goroutine enter and stay in blocking state for ever.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The following will make more explanations for the four labelled cases.
</p>

To better understand channel types and values and to make the some explanations
easier, knowing the rough internal structures of internal channel objects
is very helpful. We can think each channel maintains three queues internally:

<ol>
<li>
	the receiving goroutine queue.
	The queue is a linked list without size limitation.
	Goroutines in this queue are called blocked receiving goroutines on this channel.
	<!-- not true
	The addresses of the values which are prepared to store the received
	values are also stored in the queue along with each goroutine.
	-->
</li>
<li>
	the sending goroutine queue.
	The queue is also a linked list without size limitation.
	Goroutines in this queue are called blocked sending goroutines on this channel.
	The addresses of values these goroutines are trying to send are also
	stored in the queue along with each goroutine.
</li>
<li>
	the value buffer queue. This is a circular queue.
	Its size is equal to the capacity of the channel.
	If the current number of values stored in the value buffer queue of the channel
	reaches the capacity of the channel, the channel is called in full status.
	If no values are stored in the value buffer queue of the channel currently,
	the channel is called in empty status.
	For a zero-capacity channel, it is always in both full and empty status.
</li>
</ol>


[<u>Channel rule case A</u>]:
when a goroutine tries to receive a value from a not-closed non-nil channel,
the goroutine first tries to acquire the lock accociated with the channel,
then do the following steps until one condition is satisfied.
<ol>
<li>
	If the value buffer queue of the channel is not empty, in which
	case the receiving goroutine queue of the channel must be empty,
	the goroutine will receive (by unshifting) a value
	from the value buffer queue.
	If the sending goroutine queue of the channel is also not empty,
	a sending goroutine will be unshifted out of the sending goroutine queue
	and resumed to running state again.
	The value the just unshifted sending goroutine trying to send
	will be pushed into the value buffer queue of the channel.
	The receiving goroutine continues running.
	For this scenario, the channel send operation
	is called a <b>non-blocking operation</b>.
</li>
<li>
	Otherwise, if the value buffer queue of the channel is empty but
	the sending goroutine queue of the channel is not empty,
	in which case the channel must be an unbuffered channel,
	the receiving goroutine will unshift a sending goroutine from the
	sending goroutine queue of the channel and receive the value
	the just unshifted sending goroutine trying to send.
	The just unshifted sending goroutine will get unblocked
	and resumed to running state again.
	The receiving goroutine continues running.
	For this scenario, the channel send operation
	is called a <b>non-blocking operation</b>.
</li>
<li>
	If value buffer queue and the sending goroutine queue
	of the channel are both empty,
	the goroutine will be pushed into the receiving goroutine queue
	of the channel and enter (and stay in) blocking state.
	It may be resumed to running state when another goroutine
	sends a value to the channel later.
	For this scenario, the channel send operation
	is called a <b>blocking operation</b>.
</li>
</ol>

[<u>Channel rule case B</u>]:
when a goroutine tries to send a value to a not-closed non-nil channel,
the goroutine first tries to acquire the lock accociated with the channel,
then do the following steps until one step condition is satisfied.
<ol>
<li>
	If the receiving goroutine queue of the channel is not empty,
	in which case the value buffer queue of the channel must be empty,
	the sending goroutine will unshift a receiving goroutine
	from the receiving goroutine queue of the channel
	and send the value to the just unshifted receiving goroutine.
	The just unshifted receiving goroutine will get unblocked
	and resumed to running state again.
	The sending goroutine continues running.
	For this scenario, the channel send operation
	is called a <b>non-blocking operation</b>.
</li>
<li>
	If the receiving goroutine queue is empty
	and the value buffer queue of the channel is not full,
	in which case the sending goroutine queues must be also empty,
	the value the sending goroutine trying to send will be pushed into
	the value buffer queue, and the sending goroutine continues running.
	For this scenario, the channel send operation
	is called a <b>non-blocking operation</b>.
</li>
<li>
	If the receiving goroutine queue is empty
	and the value buffer queue of the channel is full,
	the sending goroutine will be pushed into the sending goroutine queue
	of the channel and enter (and stay in) blocking state.
	It may be resumed to running state when another goroutine
	receives a value from the channel later.
	For this scenario, the channel send operation
	is called a <b>blocking operation</b>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Once a non-nil channel is closed, sending a value to the channel will
produce a runtime panic in the current goroutine,
and the send operation is viewed as a <b>non-blocking operation</b>.
</p>

[<u>Channel rule case C</u>]:
when a goroutine tries to close a not-closed non-nil channel,
both of the following two steps will be performed by the following order.
<ol>
<li>
	If the receiving goroutine queue of the channel is not empty,
	in which case the value buffer of the channel must be empty,
	all the goroutines in the receiving goroutine queue of
	the channel will be unshifted one by one and each of them will
	receive a zero value of the element type of the channel.
</li>
<li>
	If the sending goroutine queue of the channel is not empty,
	all the goroutines in the sending goroutine queue of the channel
	will be unshifted one by one and
	each of them will produce a panic for sending on a closed channel.
	The values which have been already pushed into the value buffer
	of the channel are still there.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
[<u>Channel rule case D</u>]:
after a channel is closed,
channel receive operations on the channel will never block.
The values in the value buffer of the channel can still be received.
Once all the values in the value buffer are taken out and received,
infinite zero values of the element type of the channel will received
by any of following receive operations on the channel.
As above has mentioned,
the second return result of a channel receive operation is an untype boolean
value which indicates whether or not the first result (the received value)
is sent before the channel is closed.
</p>

<p>
Knowing what are blocking and non-blocking channel send or receive operations
is important to understand the mechanism of <code>select</code> control flow
blocks which will be introduced in a later section.
</p>

<p>
In the above explanations, if a goroutine is unshifted out of a queue
(either the sending goroutine queue or the receiving goroutine queue) of a channel,
and the goroutine was blocked for being pushed into the queue at a
<a href="#select"><code>select</code> control flow code block</a>,
then the goroutine will be resumed to running state at the step <i>9</i> of the
<a href="#select-implementation"><code>select</code> control flow code block execution</a>.
It may be dequeued from the corresponding goroutine queues of
several goroutines involved in the <code>select</code> control flow code block.
</p>

By the rules listed above, we can get some facts about the internal queues of a channel.
<ul>
<li>
	If the channel is closed,
	both of its sending goroutine queue and receiving goroutine queue must be empty,
	but its value buffer queue may not be empty.
</li>
<li>
	At any time, if the value buffer is not empty,
	then its receiving goroutine queue must be empty.
</li>
<li>
	At any time, if the value buffer is not full,
	then its sending goroutine queue must be empty.
</li>
<li>
	If the channel is buffered, then at any time,
	one of its sending goroutine queue and receiving goroutine queue must be empty.
</li>
<li>
	If the channel is unbufferd, then at any time, generally
	one of its sending goroutine queue and the receiving goroutine queue must be empty,
	but with an exception that a goroutine may be pushed into both of
	the two queues when executing a
	<a href="#select"><code>select</code> control flow code block</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Some Channel Use Examples</h3>

<div>
<p>
Let's view some channel use examples to consume the above introduced rules.
</p>

A simple request/response example.
The two goroutines in this exampe talk with each other
through an unbuffered channel.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	c := make(chan int) // an unbuffered channel
	go func() {
		x := <- c // blocking here until a value is received.
		c <- x*x  // blocking here until the result is received.
	}()
	c <- 3   // blocking here until the value is received.
	y := <-c // blocking here until the result is received.
	fmt.Println(y) // 9
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

A demo of using a buffered channel.
This program is not a concurrent one.
Once the channel is closed, infinite values can be received from it.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	c := make(chan int, 2) // a buffered channel
	c <- 3
	c <- 5
	close(c)
	fmt.Println(len(c), cap(c)) // 2 2
	x, ok := <-c
	fmt.Println(x, ok) // 3 true
	fmt.Println(len(c), cap(c)) // 1 2
	x, ok = <-c
	fmt.Println(x, ok) // 5 true
	fmt.Println(len(c), cap(c)) // 0 2
	x, ok = <-c
	fmt.Println(x, ok) // 0 false
	x, ok = <-c
	fmt.Println(x, ok) // 0 false
	fmt.Println(len(c), cap(c)) // 0 2
	close(c) // panic!
	c <- 7   // also panic if the above close call is removed.
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

A never-ending football game.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	var ball = make(chan string)
	kickBall := func(playerName string) {
		for {
			fmt.Println(<-ball, "kicked the ball.")
			time.Sleep(time.Second)
			ball <- playerName
		}
	}
	go kickBall("John")
	go kickBall("Alice")
	go kickBall("Bob")
	go kickBall("Emily")
	ball <- "referee" // kick off
	var c chan bool   // nil
	<-c               // blocking here for ever
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Please read <a href="channel-use-cases.html">channel use cases</a>
for more channel use examples.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Channel Element Values Are Transferred By Copy</h3>

<p>
When a value is sent to or receive from a channel,
a value copy occurs.
Like value assignments and function argument passing,
when a value is copied, <a href="value-part.html#about-value-copy">only
its direct part is copied</a>.
</p>

<p>
For the standard Go compiler,
the size of channel element types must be smaller than <code>65536</code>.
However, generally, we shouldn't create channels with large-size element types,
for all channel send and receive operations will copy the transferred values.
When an element value is passed from one goroutine to another,
two value copies will be made.
So if the passed value size is too large,
it is best to use a pointer element type instead,
to avoid a large value copy cost.
</p>

<h3>About Channel And Goroutine Garbage Collections</h3>

<p>
Note, a channel is referenced by all the goroutines in either
the sending or the receiving goroutine queue of the channel,
so if neither of the two queues of the channel is empty,
the channel will not be garbage collected for sure.
On the other hand, if a goroutine is blocked and stays in either
the sending or the receiving goroutine queue of a channel,
then the goroutine will also not be garbage collected for sure,
even if the channel is referenced only by this goroutine.
In fact, a goroutine can be only garbage collected when it has already exited.
</p>

<h3>Channel Send And Receive Operations Are Simple Statements</h3>

<div>
<p>
Note, channel send operations and receive operations are
<a href="expressions-and-statements.html#simple-statements">simple statements</a>.
A channel receive operation can also be used as a single-valued expression.
Simple statements and expressions can be used at certain portions of
<a href="control-flows.html">basic control flow blocks</a>.
</p>

An example in which channel send and receive operations
appear as simple statements in two <code>for</code> control flow blocks.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	fibonacci := func() chan uint64 {
		c := make(chan uint64)
		go func() {
			var x, y uint64 = 0, 1
			for ; y < (1 << 63); c <- y { // here
				x, y = y, x+y
			}
			close(c)
		}()
		return c
	}
	c := fibonacci()
	for x, ok := <-c; ok; x, ok = <-c { // here
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		fmt.Println(x)
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<p class="anchor" id="range"></p>
<h3>For-Range On Channels</h3>

<div>
The <code>for-range</code> control flow code block applies to channels.
The loop will try to iteratively receive the values sent to a channel,
until the channel is closed and no more values are still in its value buffer queue.
Unlike the <code>for range</code> syntax on arrays, slices and maps,
most one iteration variable is allowed to be present
in the <code>for range</code> syntax on channels.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">for v = range aChannel {
	// use v
}
</code></pre>

is equivalent to

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">for {
	v, ok = <-aChannel
	if !ok {
		break
	}
	// use v
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Surely, here the <code>aChannel</code> value must not be a send-only channel.
If it is a nil channel, the loop will block there for ever.
</p>

For example, the second <code>for</code> loop block in the example
shown in the last section can be simplified to

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">	for x := range c {
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		fmt.Println(x)
	}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="select"></p>
<h3><code>select-case</code> Control Flow Code Blocks</h3>

<div>
There is a <code>select-case</code> code block syntax which is specially designed for channels in Go.
The syntax is much like the <code>switch</code> block syntax, for example,
there can be multiple <code>case</code> branches and at most one
<code>default</code> branch in the <code>select-case</code> code block.
But there are also some obvious differences between them.
<ul>
<li>
	No statements and expressions are allowed to follow the <code>select</code> keyword
	(before <code>{</code>).
</li>
<li>
	No <code>fallthrough</code> statements are allowed to be used in <code>case</code> branches.
</li>
<li>
	Each statement following a <code>case</code> keyword in a <code>select-case</code> code block
	must be either a channel receive operation or a channel send operation statement.
</li>
<li>
	In case of there are some non-blocking channel operations followed
	<code>case</code> keywords in a <code>select-case</code> code block,
	Go runtime will <b>randomly select one of non-blocking channel operations to execute</b>,
	then continue to execute the corresponding <code>case</code> branch.
</li>
<li>
	In case of all the channel operations followed the <code>case</code> keywords
	in a <code>select-case</code> code block are blocking operations,
	the <code>default</code> branch will be selected to execute
	if the <code>default</code> branch is present.
	If the <code>default</code> branch is absent,
	the current goroutine will be pushed into the corresponding
	sending goroutine queue and receiving goroutine queue of
	every channels involved in the channel operations
	followed <code>case</code> keywords,
	then enter blocking state.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
By the rules, a <code>select-case</code> code block without any branches,
<code>select{}</code>, will make the current goroutine stay in blocking state forever.
</p>

The following program will enter the <code>default</code> branch for sure.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var c chan struct{} // nil
	select {
	case <-c:             // blocking operation
	case c <- struct{}{}: // blocking operation
	default:
		fmt.Println("Go here.")
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

An example showing how to use try-send and try-receive:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	c := make(chan string, 2)
	trySend := func(v string) {
		select {
		case c <- v:
		default: // go here if c is full.
		}
	}
	tryReceive := func() string {
		select {
		case v := <-c: return v
		default: return "-" // go here if c is empty.
		}
	}
	trySend("Hello!")
	trySend("Hi!")
	trySend("Bye!") // fail to send, but will not blocked.
	fmt.Println(tryReceive()) // Hello!
	fmt.Println(tryReceive()) // Hi!
	fmt.Println(tryReceive()) // -
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

The following example has 50% possibility to panic.
Both of the two <code>case</code> operations are non-blocking in this example.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	c := make(chan struct{})
	close(c)
	select {
	case c <- struct{}{}: // panic if this case is selected.
	case <-c:
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h3>The Implementation Of The Select Mechanism</h3>

<p>
The select mechanism in Go is an important and unique feature.
Here the steps of <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/select.go">the
select mechanism implementation by the official Go runtime</a> are listed.
</p>

<!--
If the step ids change, please also update the above reference ones.
-->

<div>
There are several steps to execute a select block:
<ol>
<li>
	evaluate all involved channels and values to be potentially sent, from top to bottom and left to right.
</li>
<li>
	randomize the case orders for polling (the default branch is treated as a special case).
	The corresponding channels of the orders may be duplicate.
	The default branch is always put at the last position.
</li>
<li>
	sort all involved channels to avoid deadlock in the next step.
	No duplicate channels are in the first <code>N</code> channels of the sorted result,
	where <code>N</code> is the number of involved channels in the select block.
	Below, <b><i>the sorted lock order</i></b> mean for the  the first <code>N</code> ones.
</li>
<li>
	lock all involved channels by the sorted lock order in last step.
</li>
<li>
	poll each cases in the select block by the randomized case orders:
	<ol>
	<li>
		if the corresponding channel operation is a send-value-to-closed-channel operation, unlock all channels and panic.
		Go to step 12.
	</li>
	<li>
		if the corresponding channel operation is non-blocked, perform the channel operation and unlock all channels,
		then execute the corresponding <code>case</code> branch body.
		The channel operation may wake up another blocked goroutine.
		Go to step 12.
	</li>
	<li>
		if the case is the default branch, then unlock all channels and execute the default body.
		Go to step 12.
	</li>
	</ol>
	(Up to here, there must be not a default branch and all case channel operations are blocked.)
</li>
<li>
	push (enqueue) the current goroutine (with the case channel operation information) into
	the receiving or sending goroutine queue of the involved channel in each case operation.
	The current goroutine may be pushed into the queues of a channel multiple times,
	for the involved channels in multiple cases may be the same one.
</li>
<li>
	block the current goroutine and unlock all channels by the sorted lock order.
</li>
<li>
	..., in blocking state, waiting other channel operations to wake up the current goroutine, ...
</li>
<li>
	the current goroutine is waken up by another channel operation in another goroutine.
	The other operation may be a channel close operation or a channel send/receive operation.
	If it is a channel send/receive operation, there must be a case channel receive/send operation cooperating with it.
	In the cooperation, the current goroutine will be dequeued from the receiving/sending goroutine queue of the channel.
</li>
<li>
	lock all involved channels by the sorted lock order.
</li>
<li>
	dequeue the current goroutine from the receiving goroutine queue or sending goroutine queue of the involved channel in each case operation,
	<ol>
	<li>if the current goroutine is waken up by a channel close operation, go to step 5.</li>
	<li>if the current goroutine is waken up by a channel send/receive operation,
		the corresponding case of the cooperating receive/send operation has already been found in the dequeuing process,
		so just unlock all channels by the sorted lock order and execute the corresponding case body.
	</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li>
	done.
</li>
</ol>

From the implementation, we know that
<ul>
<li>
	a goroutine may stay in the sending goroutine queues and
	the receiving goroutine queues of multiple channels at the same time.
	It can even stay in the sending goroutine queue and the
	receiving goroutine queue of the same channel at the same time.
</li>
<li>
	when a goroutine being blocked at a <code>select-case</code> code block gets resumed later,
	it will be removed from all the sending goroutine queues
	and the receiving goroutine queues of every channels
	involved in the channel operations followed <code>case</code> keywords
	in the <code>select-case</code> code block.
</li>
</ul>

Although channels can help us write
<a href="channel-closing.html">correct concurrent code easily</a>,
like other data synchronization techniques,
channels will not prevent you from
<a href="concurrent-common-mistakes.html">writing improper concurrent code</a>.
And channel may be not always the best solution for all use cases for data synchronizations.
