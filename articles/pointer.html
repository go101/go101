<h1>Pointers In Go</h1>

<p>
Although Go absorbs many features from all kinds of other languages,
Go is mainly viewed as a C family language.
One evidence is Go also supports pointers.
Go pointers and C pointers are much similar in many aspects,
but there are also some differences between Go pointers and C pointers.
This artcile will list all kinds of concepts and details related to pointers in Go.
</p>

<h3>Memory Addresses</h3>

<p>
A memory address means an offset (number of bytes) from the start point of
the whole memory managed by a system (generally, operation system).
</p>

<p>
Generally, a memory address is stored as an unsigned native (interger) word.
The size of a native word is 4 (bytes) on 32-bit architectures and 8 (bytes)
on 64-bit architectures.
So the theoretical maximum memory space size is 2<sup>32</sup> bytes,
a.k.a. 4GB (1GB == 2<sup>30</sup> bytes), on 32-bit architectures,
and is 2<sup>34</sup>GB (16 exibytes) on 64-bit architectures.
</p>

<p>
Memory addresses are often represented with hex integer literals,
such as <code>0x1234CDEF</code>.
</p>

<h3>Value Addresses</h3>

<p>
The address of a value means the start address of the memory segment
occupied by the <a href="type-system-overview.html#value-part">direct part</a>
of the value.
</p>

<p>
The next article, <a href="value-part.html">value parts</a>,
will introduce values of which kinds of types may
have indirect underlying parts.
</p>

<h3>What Are Pointers?</h3>

<p>
A pointer is a special value, which can storage a memory address.
In fact, we often call a memory address as a pointer, and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
Generally, the stored memory address in a pointer
is the address of another value.
Unlike C language, for safety reason,
there are some restrictions made for Go pointers.
Please read the following sections for details.
</p>

<h3>Go Pointer Types And Values</h3>

<div>
<p>
Same as C langauge, an unnamed pointer type can be represented with <code>*T</code>,
where <code>T</code> can be an arbitrary type.
Type <code>T</code> is called the base type of pointer type <code>*T</code>.
</p>

<p>
We can declare named pointer types,
but generally this is not recommended.
Unnamed pointer types have better readabilities than named ones.
</p>

<p>
If the <a href="type-system.html#underlying-type">underlying type</a>
of a defined pointer type is <code>*T</code>,
then the base type of the defined pointer type is <code>T</code>.
</p>

<p>
Two non-defined pointer types with the same base type are the same type.
</p>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">*int  // A unnamed pointer type whose base type is int.
**int // A multi-level unnamed pointer type whose base type is *int.

type Ptr *int // Ptr is a defined pointer type whose base type is int.
type PP *Ptr  // PP is a defined pointer type whose base type is Ptr.
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Zero values of any pointer types are represented with the predeclared <code>nil</code>.
No addresses are stored in nil pointer values.
</p>

<p>
A pointer value of a pointer type whose base type is <code>T</code>
can be called a <code>T</code> pointer.
The value located at (the address stored in) a non-nil
<code>T</code> pointer will be always viewed as
a value of type <code>T</code> by compilers.
</p>

</div>

<h3>How To Get A Pointer Value And What Are Addressable Values?</h3>

<div>
There are two ways to get a non-nil pointer value.
<ol>
<li>
	The built-in <code>new</code> function can be used to allocate memory for a value
	of any type. <code>new(T)</code> will allocate memory for a <code>T</code> value
	and return the address of the <code>T</code> value.
	The allocated value is a zero value of type <code>T</code>.
	The returned address is viewed as a pointer value of type <code>*T</code>.
</li>
<li>
	We can also take the addresses of some values in Go.
	Values can be taken addresses are called addressable values.
	For an addressable value <code>t</code> of type <code>T</code>,
	we can use the expression <code>&amp;t</code> to
	take the address of <code>t</code>,
	where <code>&amp;</code> is the operator to take value addresses.
	The type of <code>&amp;t</code> is viewed as <code>*T</code>.
</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
All variables are addressable and all constants are unaddressable.
Not all values stored in memory at run time are addressable in Go.
We can learn other adressable and unadressable values from other articles later.
If you have already been familar with Go, you can read
<a href="summaries.html#not-addressable">this summary</a> to get
the lists of adressable and unadressable values in Go.
</p>

<p>
Although addressable values can be modified,
their addressess are immutable in their respective lifetime.
</p>

<p>
The next section will show how to get pointer values.
</p>

<h3>Pointer Dereference</h3>

<p>
Given a pointer value <code>p</code> of type <code>T<sub>p</sub></code>,
how to get the value at the address stored in the pointer?
Just use the expression <code>*p</code>, where <code>*</code> is called dereference operator.
<code>*p</code> is call the dereference of poiner <code>p</code>.
Pointer dereference is the inverse process of address taking.
The result of <code>*p</code> is a value of the base type of <code>T<sub>p</sub></code>.
</p>

<p>
Dereferencing a nil pointer causes a runtime panic.
</p>

<div>
The following programm shows some address taking
and pointer dereference examples:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	p0 := new(int)   // p0 points to a zero int value.
	fmt.Println(p0)  // (a hex address string)
	fmt.Println(*p0) // 0
	
	// x is a copy of the value at the address stored in p0.
	x := *p0
	p1, p2 := &x, &x      // both take address of x.
	fmt.Println(p1 == p2) // true
	fmt.Println(p0 == p1) // false
	p3 := &*p0            // <=> p3 := &(*p0)
	fmt.Println(p0 == p3) // true
	*p0, *p1 = 123, 789
	fmt.Println(*p2, x, *p3) // 789 789 123
	
	fmt.Printf("%T, %T \n", *p0, x) // int, int
	fmt.Printf("%T, %T \n", p0, p1) // *int, *int
}
</code></pre>

<p>
<p>

<p>
The following picture depicts the relations of the values
used in the above program.
<br/>
<img src="res/pointer.png">
<br/>
</p>
</div>

<h3>About The Word "Reference"</h3>

<p>
In Go 101, the word "reference" means indicates a relation.
For example, if a pointer value storages the address of another value,
then we can say the pointer value (directly) references the other value,
and the other value has at least one reference.
The uses of the word "reference" in Go 101 are consistent with Go specification.
</p>

<h3>Why Do We Need Pointers?</h3>

<div>
Let's view an example firstly.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func double(a int) {
	a += a
}

func main() {
	var a = 3
	double(a)
	fmt.Println(a) // 3
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The <code>double</code> function is the above example is expected to modify
the input argument by doubling it. However, it fails. Why?
Because all value assignments, including function argument passing,
are value copying in Go.
What the <code>double</code> function modified is a copy of the input argument.
Modifications on (the direct part of) a copy of an original value
don't affect the original value.
</p>

One solution to fix the above <code>double</code> function is let it return
the modification result. This solution doesn't always work for all scenarios.
The following example shows another solution, by using a pointer parameter.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func double(a *int) {
	*a += *a
	a = nil // This line is just for education purpose.
}

func main() {
	var a = 3
	double(&a)
	fmt.Println(a) // 6
	p := &a
	double(p)
	fmt.Println(a, p == nil) // 12 false
}
</code></pre>

<p>
We can find that, by changing the parameter to a pointer type,
the passed pointer argument and its copy reference the same same,
so the modification on the referenced value, the local variable
<code>a</code>, can be reflected out of the <code>double</code> function.
</p>

<p>
Surely, the modification of the copy of the passed pointer argument itself
still can't be reflected on the passed pointer argument.
After the second <code>double</code> function call, the local pointer
<code>p</code> doesn't get modified to <code>nil</code>.
</p>

<p>
In short, pointers provide indirect ways to access some values
so that these values can be avoided being copied.
Many languages have not the pointer concept,
however, pointers are just hidden under other concepts in those languages.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Return Pointers Of Local Variables Is Safe In Go</h3>

<div>
Unlike C language, Go is a language supporting garbage collection,
so return the address of a local variable is absolutely safe in Go.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func newInt() *int {
	a := 3
	return &a
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Restrictions On Pointers In Go</h3>

<p>
For safety reasons,
Go makes some restrictions to guarantee pointers in Go are always legal and safe.
By applying these restrictions, Go keeps the benefits of pointers,
and avoids the dangerousness of pointers at the same time.
</p>

<h4>Poiner Values Don't Support Arithmetic Operations</h4>

<div>
<p>
In Go, pointers can't do arithmetic operations.
For a pointer value <code>p</code>, statement <code>p++</code> is illegal in Go.
If <code>p</code> is a pointer to a numeric value,
then <code>*v++</code> will be treated as <code>(*v)++</code> by Go compilers.
</p>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	a := int64(5)
	p := &a
	
	// The following two lines don't compile.
	/*
	p++
	p = (&a) + 8
	*/
	
	*p++
	fmt.Println(*p, a)   // 6 6
	fmt.Println(p == &a) // true
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>A Poiner Value Can't Be Converted To An Arbitrary Pointer Type</h4>

<div>
In Go, a pointer value of pointer type <code>T1</code> can be directly converted
to another pointer type <code>T2</code> only if either of the following two conditions
is get satisfied.
<ol>
<li>
	The underlying types of type <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> are identical (ignoring struct tags),
	in particular if either <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> is an unnamed type
	and they underlying types are identical (considering struct tags),
	then the conversion can be implicit.
	(Struct types and values will be explained in
	<a href="struct.html">the next article</a>.)
</li>
<li>
	Type <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> are both unnamed pointer types and
	the underlying types of their base types are identical.
</li>
</ol>

By example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type MyInt int64
type Ta    *int64
type Tb    *MyInt
</code></pre>

For the 4 pointer types shown above,
<ol>
<li>
	values of type <code>*int64</code> can be implicitly converted to type <code>Ta</code>,
	and vice versa, for their underlying types are both <code>*int64</code>.
</li>
<li>
	values of type <code>*MyInt</code> can be implicitly converted to type <code>Tb</code>,
	and vice versa, for their underlying types are both <code>*MyInt</code>.
</li>
<li>
	values of type <code>*MyInt</code> can be explicitly converted to type <code>Tb</code>,
	and vice versa, for the underlying types of their base types are both <code>int64</code>
	and they are both unnamed.
</li>
<li>
	values of type <code>Ta</code> can't be directly converted to type <code>Tb</code>,
	even if explicitly.
	However, by the just listed first three facts, a value <code>pa</code> of
	type <code>Ta</code> can be indirectly converted to type <code>Tb</code>
	by nesting three explicit conversions, <code>Tb((*MyInt)((*int64)(pa)))</code>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
None of the 4 pointers can be converted to type <code>*uint64</code>, in any safe ways.
</p>
</div>

<h4>A Poiner Value Can't Be Compared With Values Of An Arbitrary Pointer Type</h4>

<div>
In Go, pointers can be compared with <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators.
Two Go pointer values can only be compared if either of the following three conditions
are satisified.
<ol>
<li>
	The types of the two Go pointers are identical.
</li>
<li>
	One pointer value can be implicitly converted to the pointer type of the other.
	In other words, the underlying types of the two types must be identical
	and either of the two types of the two Go pointers must be an unnamed type.
</li>
<li>
	One and only one of the two pointers is represented with the bare <code>nil</code> identifier.
</li>
</ol>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	type MyInt int64
	type Ta    *int64
	type Tb    *MyInt
	
	// 4 nil pointers of different types.
	var pa0 Ta
	var pa1 *int64
	var pb0 Tb
	var pb1 *MyInt
	
	// The following 6 lines compile okay.
	// The comparison results are all true.
	_ = pa0 == pa1
	_ = pb0 == pb1
	_ = pa0 == nil
	_ = pa1 == nil
	_ = pb0 == nil
	_ = pb1 == nil
	
	// None of the following 3 lines compile.
	/*
	_ = pa0 == pb0
	_ = pa1 == pb1
	_ = pa0 == Tb(nil)
	*/
}
</code></pre>
<p>
</p>
</div>

<h4>A Poiner Value Can't Be Assigned To Pointer Values Of Other Pointer Types</h4>

<p>
The conditions to assign a pointer value to another pointer value are the
same as the conditions to compare a pointer value to another pointer value,
which are listed above.
</p>

<h3>It's Possible To Break The Go Pointer Restrictions</h3>

<p>
As the start of this article has mentioned,
the mechanisms (specifically, the <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> type)
provided by <a href="unsafe.html">the <code>unsafe</code> standard package</a>
can be used to break the restrictions made for pointers in Go.
The <code>unsafe.Pointer</code> type is like the <code>void*</code> in C.
However, generally, the unsafe ways are not recommended to
be used in general Go programming.
