This articles will introduce type alignment guarantees in Go.
It is essential to know the guarantees to
properly use the 64-bit functions in <code>sync/atomic</code> standard package.
</p>

<p>
Go is a C family language,
so you will find many concepts talked in this article are shared with C.
</p>

<h3>Type Alignment Guarantees In Go</h3>

<p>
Type alignment (or value address alignment) guarantees are the requirements
for Go compilers made by Go specification.
If the alignment guarantee of a type <code>T</code> is <code>N</code>,
then the address of every value of type <code>T</code> must be a multiple of <code>N</code> at run time.
We can also say the addresses of values of type <code>T</code> are promised to be N-aligned.
</p>

<p>
In fact, each type has two alignment guarantees, one is for when it is used fields of other (struct) types,
the other is for other cases (when it is used for a variable declaration, array element type, etc).
We call the former one the field alignment guarantee of that type,
and call the latter one the general alignment guarantee of that type.
</p>

<p>
At compile time, for a type <code>T</code>, we can call <code>unsafe.Alignof(t)</code> to
get its general alignment guarantee, where <code>t</code> is a non-field value of type <code>T</code>,
and call <code>unsafe.Alignof(x.t)</code> to
get its field alignment guarantee, where <code>x.t</code> is a field value of type <code>T</code>.
</p>

<p>
At run time, for a value <code>t</code> of type <code>T</code>,
we can call <code>reflect.ValueOf(t).Type().Align()</code> to get the general alignment guarantee
of type <code>T</code>, and call <code>reflect.ValueOf(t).Type().FieldAlign()</code> to get
the field alignment guarantee of type <code>T</code>.
</p>

<p>
For the current standard Go compiler, the field alignment guarantee and the general alignment guarantee
of a type are always equal. For gccgo compiler, the statement is false.
</p>

<p>
Following of the article will use alignment guarantee to refer to either guarantee.
</p>

<div>
Go specification only mentions <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Size_and_alignment_guarantees">a little
on type alignment guarantees</a>:
<blockquote>
<small>
The following minimal alignment properties are guaranteed:
<ol>
<li>For a variable <code>x</code> of any type: <code>unsafe.Alignof(x)</code> is at least <code>1</code>.</li>
<li>For a variable <code>x</code> of struct type: <code>unsafe.Alignof(x)</code> is the largest of all the values <code>unsafe.Alignof(x.f)</code> for each field <code>f</code> of <code>x</code>, but at least <code>1</code>.</li>
<li>For a variable <code>x</code> of array type: <code>unsafe.Alignof(x)</code> is the same as the alignment of a variable of the array's element type..</li>
</ol>
</small>
</blockquote>

<p>
The guarantees don't specify the exact alignment guarantees for any types.
It just specifies some minimal requirements.
For the same compiler, the exact type alignment guarantees may be different
between different architectures and between different compiler versions.
</p>
</div>

<div>
For the current version (v1.10) of the standard Go compiler,
the alignment guarantees are listed here:
<pre>
type                               alignment guarantee
------                             ------
bool, byte, uint8, int8            1
uint16, int16                      2
uint32, int32, float32, complex64  4
other types                        size of a native word
</pre>
<p>
Here, a native word (or machine word) is 4-byte sized
on 32-bit architectures and 8-byte sized on 64-bit architectures.
</p>

<!--
todo: above assertion may be not correct for some architectures?
-->
</div>

<p>
This means, for the current version of the standard Go compiler,
the alignment guarantees of other types may be either <code>4</code> or <code>8</code>,
depends on the build target.
</p>

<p>
Generally, we don't need to care about the value address alignments in Go programming,
except that we want to write portable programs and
use the 64-bit functions from <code>sync/atomic</code> package.
</p>

<h3>64-bit Word Atomic Assessment Guarantees</h3>

<p><i>
(In this article, <b><i>64-bit words</i></b> mean values of types
whose underlying types are <code>int64</code> or <code>uint64</code>.)
</i></p>

<div>
At the end of the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/#pkg-note-BUG">sync/atomic documentation</a>,
it mentions:
<br/>
<blockquote>
<small>
On x86-32, the 64-bit functions use instructions unavailable before the Pentium MMX.
<br/><br/>
On non-Linux ARM, the 64-bit functions use instructions unavailable before the ARMv6k core.
<br/><br/>
On both ARM and x86-32, it is the caller's responsibility to
arrange for 64-bit alignment of 64-bit words accessed atomically.
The first word in a variable or in an allocated struct, array,
or slice can be relied upon to be 64-bit aligned.
</small>
</blockquote>

<p><i>
(Here, <code>64-bit</code> in the last sentence is appended by context.
Although the above quoted texts shown in the bug zone of that documentation,
what they describe are not bugs.)
</i></p>
</div>

<p>
So, on very old CPU architectures, 64-bit atomic functions are not supported.
Programs will panic when 64-bit atomic functions are called on such platforms.
If a program is expected to support these architectures,
<code>sync.Mutex</code> should be used instead to synchronize 64-bit words.
<code>sync.Mutex</code> is less efficient than atomic functions.
</p>

<p>
On 64-bit CPU architectures, 64-bit word values are always 8-byte aligned,
so we can call the 64-bit atomic functions safely.
</p>

<p>
What we do need to pay attention to is 64-bit word atomic assessments
on some not-very-old 32-bit architectures.
64-bit atomic functions are supported on these architectures,
but the addresses of 64-bit word values are not guaranteed to
be 8-byte aligned on these architectures.
Calls of 64-bit atomic functions for 64-bit words which addresses
are not 8-byte aligned may panic at run time.
</p>

<p>
However, on the not-very-old 32-bit architectures,
the official documentation guarantees that
<b><i>the first word in a variable or in an allocated struct,
array, or slice can be relied upon to be 64-bit aligned</i></b>.
</p>

<!--
<p>
In my honest opinion, the wording is very vague.
And it is very conservative.

In fact, Ian, one of the core member of Go team,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/_nHK6P8_lhw">clarified</a> that
local declared 64-bit word variables can also be relied upon to be 8-byte aligned.
</p>
-->

<p>
What does the word <b><i>allocated</i></b> mean?
You can think an <b><i>allocated</i></b> value
as a <b><i>declared</i></b> variable or a value returned
by the <code>new</code> and <code>make</code> functions.
If a slice value is derived from an alloacted array and
the first element of the slice is the first element of the array,
then the slice value can also be viewed as an alloacted value.
</p>

<p>
The guarantees made by the official documentation is very conservative.
In fact, if a value is located at the start address of
a <a href="memory-block.html">memory block</a> allocated on heap,
then the first word in the value can be relied upon to be 64-bit aligned.
</p>

<p>
And <b><i>be relied upon to be 8-byte aligned</i></b> doesn't mean the address of
the first 64-bit word in a global variable or in an allocated struct or array
is always 8-byte aligned on 32-bit architectures.
It just means if the first 64-bit word in such a value is ever accessed atomically,
then compilers must guarantee the memory address of that value is 8-byte aligned at run time.
If it is never accessed atomically, its address is not guaranteed to be 8-byte aligned.
</p>

<p>
There are more other 64-bit words which can also be accessed atomically.
It is just some subtle and verbose to make a simple clear definition in wording,
so official documentations just makes conservative guarantees.
</p>

<p>
By common sense, a qualified compiler should promise that
all elements in an array/slice can also be accessed atomically
if the element type of the array/slice is a 64-bit word type
and there is one element in the array/slice could be accessed atomically,
though official documentations doesn't make this guarantee.
</p>

<div>
Here is an example which lists some 64-bit words
which are safe or unsafe to be accessed atomically:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type (
	T1 struct {
		v uint64
	}

	T2 struct {
		_ int16
		x T1
		y *T1
	}

	T3 struct {
		_ int16
		x [6]int64
		y *[6]int64
	}
)

// below, the "safe"s in comments mean "safe to be accessed atomically
// on both 64-bit and 32-bit architectures".

var a int64    // a is safe
var b T1       // b.v is safe
var c [6]int64 // c[0] is safe

var d T2 // d.x.v is unsafe
var e T3 // e.x[0] is unsafe

func f() {
	var f int64           // f is safe
	var g = []int64{5: 0} // g[0] is safe

	var h = e.x[:] // h[0] is unsafe

	// here, d.y.v and e.y[0] are both safe, for they are allocated.
	d.y = new(T1)
	e.y = &[6]int64{}

	_, _, _ = f, g, h
}

// In fact, all elements in c, g and e.y.v are safe to be accessed
// atomically, though the official documentations don't make the
// guarantees.
</code></pre>

<p>
Package maintainers should beware of exposing types
with 64-bit fields accessed atomically.
For example, it is unsafe to embed the <code>Int</code> and
<code>Float</code> types from the
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/expvar/">expvar standard package</a>
in user code which would run on 32-bit architectures.
</p>
</div>

<div>
If you can't make sure whether or not a 64-bit word can be accessed atomically,
you can use a value of type <code>[15]byte</code> to determine
the address for the 64-bit word at run time:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package mylib

import (
	"unsafe"
	"sync/atomic"
)

type Counter struct {
	x [15]byte // instead of "x uint64"
}

func (c *Counter) xAddr() *uint64 {
	// the return must be 8-byte aligned.
	return (*uint64)(unsafe.Pointer(
		uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&c.x)) + 8 -
		uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&c.x))%8))
}

func (c *Counter) Add(delta uint64) {
	p := c.xAddr()
	atomic.AddUint64(p, delta)
}

func (c *Counter) Value() uint64 {
	return atomic.LoadUint64(c.xAddr())
}
</code></pre>

<p>
By using this solution, the <code>Counter</code> type can be embedded in other user types safely,
even on 32-bit architectures.
The drawback of this solution is there are seven bytes being wasted for every value of <code>Counter</code> type.
For the standard compiler, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/sync/waitgroup.go#L23">a <code>[12]byte</code> value can used instead</a>,
which only waste four bytes.
</p>

<p><i>
(BTW, the solution in the just mentioned standard package assumes that any Go compiler
should make sure the alignment guarantees of 64-bit words must be 4N on any architectures.
However, I can't find the guarantee written in any official Go documentation.)
</i></p>
</div>

<h3>Future Possible Change</h3>

<p>
Russ Cox, one core Go team member, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/599">has proposed that the addresses of 64-bit words
should always be 8-byte aligned</a>, either on 64-bit or 32-bit architectures, to make Go programming simpler.
Currently (Go 1.10), this proposal hasn't been adopted yet.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="size-and-padding"></p>
<h3>Type Value Sizes And Structure Padding</h3>

<div>
Go specification only makes following <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Size_and_alignment_guarantees">type size guarantees</a>:
<pre>
type                               size in bytes
------                             ------
byte, uint8, int8                   1
uint16, int16                       2
uint32, int32, float32              4
uint64, int64, float64, complex64   8
complex128                         16
</pre>
<p>
Go specification doesn't make value size guarantees for other types.
For the current version (v1.10) of the standard Go compiler,
<code>bool</code> values are one-byte sized and
<code>int</code>/<code>uint</code>/<code>uintptr</code>/pointer values
are one-native-word sized.
The full list of value sizes of different types settled
by the standard Go compiler are listed in
<a href="memory-layout.html#value-sizes">this article</a>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The standard Go compiler will ensure the size of values of a type
is a multiple of the alignment guarantee of the type.
</p>

<p>
To satisfy type alignment guarantees mentioned in previous sections,
Go compiler and runtime may pad some bytes between fields of struct values.
This makes the value size of a struct type may be not a simple
sum of the sizes of all fields of the type.
</p>

<div>
Here is an example showing how bytes are padded between struct fields:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// The alignments of type T1 and T2 are the same as
// the largest alignment of their field types (int64),
// 8 on AMD64 OS and 4 on i386 OS.

type T1 struct {
	a int8
	// To make b 8-aligned on AMD64 OS and 4-aligned on i386 OS,
	// 7 bytes padded on AMD64 OS and pad 3 bytes padded on i386 OS here.
	b int64
	c int16
	// To make the size of T1 values is a multiple of the alignment of T1,
	// 6 bytes padded on AMD64 OS and pad 2 bytes padded on i386 OS here.
}
// the sizes of T1 values are 24 on AMD64 OS and 16 on i386 OS.

type T2 struct {
	a int8
	// To make c 2-aligned,
	// 1 byte padded on both AMD64 and i386 OS here.
	c int16
	// To make b 8-aligned on AMD64 OS and 4-aligned on i386 OS,
	// 4 bytes padded on AMD64 OS here. No padding on i386 OS.
	b int64
}
// the sizes of T2 values are 16 on AMD64 OS and 12 on i386 OS.
</code></pre>

<p>
Although <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> have the same field set,
their value sizes are different.
</p>
</div>

<div>
One interesting fact for the standard Go compiler
is that sometimes zero sized fields may affect structure padding.
Please read <a href="unofficial-faq.html#final-zero-size-field">this question in the unoffcial Go FAQ</a>
for details.
