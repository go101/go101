<h3>
	What does the compile error message <code>non-name *** on left side of :=</code> mean?
</h3>

Up to now (Go 1.10), there is <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Short_variable_declarations">a mandatory rule</a>
for short variable declarations:
<div class="alert alert-success">
All items at the left side of <code>:=</code> must be pure
<a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Identifiers">identifiers</a> and at least one of them must be a new variable name.
</div>
This means container elements (<code>x[i]</code>),
struct fields (<code>x.f</code>), pointer dereferences and qualified identifiers
can't appear at the left side of <code>:=</code>.

<p>
Currently, there is an <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/377">open issue</a>
(which was merged with <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/6842">a more related one</a>)
for this problem. It looks Go authors want to leave this problem unresolved until Go 2.0.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="error-missing-left-brace"></p>
<h3>
	What does the compile error message <code>unexpected newline, expecting { ...</code> mean?
</h3>

<div>
<p>
In Go, we can't break a code line at an arbitrary position.
Please read <a href="line-break-rules.html">line break rules in Go </a> for details.
By the rules, generally, it is not okay to break code lines just before the open brackets.
</p>

For example, the following code

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">if true
{
}

for i := 0; i < 10; i++
{
}

var _ = []int
{
	1, 2, 3
}
</code></pre>

will be interpreted as

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">if true;
{
}

for i := 0; i < 10; i++;
{
}

var _ = []int;
{
	1, 2, 3;
}
</code></pre>

Go compilers will report an error for each open bracket <code>{</code>.
To avoid these errors, we should rewrite the above code as the following.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">if true {
}

for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
}

var _ = []int {
	1, 2, 3,
}
</code></pre>

</div>

<p class="anchor" id="error-declared-not-used"></p>
<h3>
	What does the compiler error message <code>declared and not used</code> mean?
</h3>

<div>
<p>
For the standard Go compiler, each variable declared in local code blocks
must be used as a RHS value (right-hand side) for at lease once.
</p>

So the following code fails to compile.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func f(x bool) {
	var y = 1 // y declared and not used
	if x {
		y = 2
	}
}
</code></pre>

</div>


<p class="anchor" id="map-iteration-order"></p>
<h3>
	Does Go runtime maintain the iteration orders for maps?
</h3>

<p>
No. <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#For_range">Go 1 specification</a>
says the iteration order over maps is not specified and
is not guaranteed to be the same from one iteration to the next.
For the standard Go compiler, the map iteration orders are some randomized.
If you require a stable iteration order for a map you must maintain the order by yourself.
Please read <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go-maps-in-action#TOC_7.">Go maps in action</a> for more information.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="compiler-field-padding"></p>
<h3>
	Will Go compilers do padding to ensure field alignments for struct types?
</h3>

<p>
At least for the standard Go compiler and gccgo, the answer is yes.
Padding is OS and compiler dependent.
</p>

<div>
Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type T1 struct {
	a int8
	// 7 bytes padded on AMD64 OS and pad 3 bytes padded on i386 OS here
	b int64
	c int16
	// 6 bytes padded on AMD64 OS and pad 2 bytes padded on i386 OS here
}

type T2 struct {
	a int8
	// 1 byte padded on both AMD64 and i386 OS here
	c int16
	// 4 bytes padded on AMD64 OS here. No padding on i386 OS
	b int64
}
</code></pre>
<p>
The addresses of <code>T1.b</code> values in memory must be 8-byte aligned on AMD64 OS
and 4-byte aligned on i386 OS, this is why there will be 7 bytes padded on AMD64 OS and
3 bytes padded on i386 OS after <code>T1.a</code>.
</p>
<p>
Go specification makes <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Size_and_alignment_guarantees">some guarantees for type alignments</a>.
One of them is the alignment of a struct type is its largest alignment of its field types.
So <code>T1</code> is also 8-byte aligned on AMD64 OS and 4-byte aligned on i386
(same as type of <code>T1.b</code>, <code>int64</code>),
and the standard Go compiler will ensure the size of values of a type is a multiple of the alignment guarantee of the type,
this is why there will be 6 bytes padded on AMD64 OS and 2 bytes
padded on i386 OS at the end of <code>T1</code> values.
</p>
<p>
The orders of the fields in a struct will affect padding, and padding will affect the size of the struct afterwards.
On AMD64 OS, the size of <code>T1</code> values is 24, but the size of <code>T2</code> values is 16.
</p>
<p>
Go Compilers will not rearrange struct fields to minimize struct value sizes.
Doing this may cause some unexpected results.
However, programmers can minimize padding by reordering the fields manually.
</p>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="final-zero-size-field"></p>
<h3>
	Why does the final field of a zero-sized type in a struct contribute to the size of the struct sometimes?
</h3>

<p><i>
(This is not a Go spec rule. It is a compiler specified implementation.
Here is the compiler is the standard Go compiler.
Please view <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/9401">issue#9401</a> for details.)
</i></p>

In the current standard Go runtime implementation, if a memory block is referenced by
at least one active pointer, then the memory block will not be viewed as garbage and will not be collected.
All the fields of an addressable struct value can be taken addresses.
If the size of the final field in a non-zero-sized struct is zero, then taking the address of
the final field in the struct value will return an address which beyonds the allocated memory block
for the struct value. The returned address may
<ul>
<li>
	point to another allocated memory block. If an active pointer stores the address,
	it will prevent the garbage collector from collecting the other allocated memory block,
	which causes memory leaking.
</li>
<li>
	point to an unallocated memory area. This will cause the garbage collector to
	re-collect the unallocated memory and may crash programs.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
To avoid the problems, the Go standard compiler will ensure that taking the address of
the final field in a non-zero-sized struct will never return an address which beyonds
the allocated memory block for the struct.
The Go standard compiler implements this by padding some bytes before the final zero-sized field
when needed.
</p>

<p>
If the types of all fields in a struct type are zero-sized
(so the struct is also a zero-sized type), then there is no need to pad bytes in the struct,
for the Go standard compiler treats zero-sized types specially.
</p>

<div>
Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"unsafe"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	type T1 struct {
		a struct{}
		x int64
	}
	fmt.Println(unsafe.Sizeof(T1{})) // 8
	
	type T2 struct {
		x int64
		a struct{}
	}
	fmt.Println(unsafe.Sizeof(T2{})) // 16
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="new-function"></p>
<h3>
	Is <code>new(T)</code> a sugar of <code>var t T; (&t)</code>?
</h3>

<p>
Generally you can think so.
The memory block allocated by <code>new</code> may be either on stack or on heap.
There would some other subtle differences, depending on compiler implementation.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="fatal-error-deadlock"></p>
<h3>
	What does the runtime error message <code>all goroutines are asleep - deadlock</code> mean?
</h3>

<p>
The word <b><i>asleep</i></b> is not accurate here, it means
<b><i>in blocking state</i></b> in fact.
As a blocking goroutine can only be unblocked by another goroutine,
if all goroutines in a program enter blocking state,
then all of they will stay in blocking state for ever.
This means the program is deadlocked.
A normal running program is never expected to be deadlocked,
so the standard Go runtime makes the program crash and exit.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="64-bit-alignment"></p>
<h3>
	Are 64-bit variables and struct fields guaranteed to be 64-bit aligned
	so that they can be accessed atomically?
</h3>

<p>
The addresses passed to the 64-bit functions in <code>sync/atomic</code> package
must be 64-bit aligned, otherwise, calls to these functions may panic at run time.
</p>

<p>
For Go programs run on 64-bit OSes, 64-bit values are guaranteed to be 64-bit aligned.
So they can be accessed atomically.
</p>

<div>
For Go programs run on 32-bit OSes, there is no the universal guarantee.
But following 64-bit words are guaranteed to be able to be accessed atomically:
<ul>
<li>allocated 64-bit words.</li>
<li>the first field in an allocated struct if the field is a 64-bit word.</li>
<li>the first word in the first elements of an allocated array if the word is 64-bit.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Here, an <b><i>allocated</i></b> value means the address of the value is
the start address of the memory block the value locates at.
In other words, the value is placed at the beginning of the memory block it locates at.
</p>

<p>
A qualified Go compiler should promise that
all elements in an array/slice can also be accessed atomically
if one element in the array/slice can be accessed atomically
and the element type is a 64-bit word type,
though the official documentation doesn't make this guarantee.
</p>

<div>
Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"sync/atomic"
)

type T struct {
	a uint64
	b bool
	c int64
}

type V struct {
	d byte
	t T // t.a is not the first field in V.
}

var x int64
var y [3]uint64
var z = make([]int64, 5)
var t T

var v V

func main() {
	var x2 int64
	var y2 [3]uint64
	var z2 = make([]int64, 5)
	var t2 T
	
	var v2 = new(V)
	
	// following lines are guaranteed to be safe on
	// both 64-bit and 32-bit OS.
	atomic.LoadInt64(&x)
	atomic.LoadUint64(&y[1])
	atomic.LoadInt64(&z[2])
	atomic.LoadUint64(&t.a)
	
	atomic.LoadInt64(&x2)
	atomic.LoadUint64(&y2[1])
	atomic.LoadInt64(&z2[2])
	atomic.LoadUint64(&t2.a)
	
	// the following two lines are safe on 64-bit OS
	// but may be panic on 32-bit OS	
	atomic.LoadUint64(&v.t.a)
	atomic.LoadUint64(&v2.t.a)
}
</code></pre>

</div>

<p class="anchor" id="atomical-assignment"></p>
<h3>
	Are assignments of values atomic operations?
</h3>

<p>
No for the standard Go compiler, even if the sizes of the assigned values are one word.
</p>

<p>
Pleae view <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#What_operations_are_atomic_What_about_mutexes">the official question</a> for more details.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="zero-values-zero-bytes"></p>
<h3>
	Is every zero value composed of a sequence of zero bytes in memory?
</h3>

<div>
<p>
For most types, this is true.
In fact, this is compiler dependent.
For example, for the standard Go runtime,
the statement is wrong for some zero values of string types.
</p>

Evidence:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"unsafe"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	var s1 string
	fmt.Println(s1 == "") // true
	fmt.Println(*(*uintptr)(unsafe.Pointer(&s1))) // 0
	var s2 = "abc"[0:0]
	fmt.Println(s2 == "") // true
	fmt.Println(*(*uintptr)(unsafe.Pointer(&s2))) // 4869856
	fmt.Println(s1 == s2) // true
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
Inversely, for all the processors/architectures the standard Go compiler currently supports,
if all bytes in a value are zero, then the value must be a zero value of its type.
However, Go specification doesn't guarantee this.
I have heard that on some very old processors,
nil pointers are not zero in memory.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="function-inline"></p>
<h3>
	Does the standard Go compiler support function inline?
</h3>

<p>
Yes, the standard Go compiler supports function inline.
The compiler will inline short leaf functions, automatically.
Leaf functions are the functions which doesn't contain function calls.
The specific inline rules may change from version to version.
</p>

<div>
Currently (Go 1.10), for the standard Go compiler,
<ul>
<li>there is no explicit ways to specify which functions should be inlined in user programs.</li>
<li>although <code>-gcflags "-l"</code> build option can prevent any functions being inlined,
	there is no formal ways to avoid specified functions being inlined in user programs.
	There are really informal ways (both of them would become invalid for future Go standard compiler versions):
	<ul>
	<li>you can add a line <code>//go:noinline</code> directive before a function declaration to avoid the function being inlined.</li>
	<li>as functions containing loop blocks will not be inlined,
		you can add a <code>for false {}</code> line in a function to avoid the function being inlined.
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="anchor" id="get-days-of-month"></p>
<h3>
	How to get the number of days of any month by using as few code lines as possible?
</h3>

<div>
Assume the input year is a nature year and the input month is also a nature month (January is 1).
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">days := time.Date(year, month+1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC).Day()
</code></pre>
For Go time APIs, the usual month range is [1, 12] and the start day of each month is 1.
The start time of a month <code>m</code> in year <code>y</code> is
<code>time.Date(y, m, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC)</code>.
<p>
The arguments passed to <code>time.Date</code> can be outside their usual ranges
and will be normalized during the conversion.
For example, January 32 will be converted to February 1.
</p>

Here are some date usage examples in Go:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"time"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	// 2017-02-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC
	fmt.Println(time.Date(2017, 1, 32, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC))
	
	// 2017-01-31 23:59:59.999999999 +0000 UTC
	fmt.Println(time.Date(2017, 1, 32, 0, 0, 0, -1, time.UTC))
	
	// 2017-01-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC
	fmt.Println(time.Date(2017, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC))
	
	// 2016-12-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC
	fmt.Println(time.Date(2016, 13, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC))
	
	// 2017-02-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC
	fmt.Println(time.Date(2016, 13, 32, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC))
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="time-sleep-after"></p>
<h3>
	What is the difference between the function call <code>time.Sleep(d)</code> and the channel receive operation <code>&lt;-time.After(d)</code>?
</h3>

<p>
Thw two will both pause the currrent goroutine execution for a certain duration.
The difference is the function call <code>time.Sleep(d)</code>
will let the current goroutine enter sleeping status (not a goroutine state),
but still stay in <a href="control-flows-more.html#states-of-goroutine">running state</a>,
whereas, the channel receive operation <code>&lt;-time.After(d)</code>
will let the current goroutine enter blocking state.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="finalizers"></p>
<h3>
	Can I use finalizers as object destructors?
</h3>

<p>
In Go programs, we can set a finalizer function for an object by using
the <code>runtime.SetFinalizer</code> function. The finalizer function
will be called before the object is garbage collected.
But finalizers are never intended to be used as destructors of objects.
The finalizers set by <code>runtime.SetFinalizer</code> are not guaranteed to run.
So you shouldn't rely on finalizers for your program correctness.
</p>

<p>
The main intention of finalizers is for libraries maintainers to
make extra efforts to remedy the damage caused by libraries users don't use the
libraries correctly. For example, in a program, if we use the <code>os.Open</code> to open
many files but forget to close them after using them, then the program
will hold many file descriptors until the program exits. This is resource leak.
To avoid the program holding too many file descriptors, the maintainers of the
<code>os</code> package will set a finalizer on the every created <code>os.File</code>
object. The finalizer will close the file descriptor stored in the <code>os.File</code>
object. As above mentioned, the finalizers are not guaranteed to be called.
They are just used to make the extent of resource leak as small as possible.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, to avoid a finalizer of an object being called too early, we can use the
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#KeepAlive">runtime.KeepAlive</a> function

<h3>
	Calls of the <code>TrimLeft</code> and <code>TrimRight</code> functions in the <code>strings</code> and <code>bytes</code>
		standard packages often return unexpected results, are there bugs in these function implementations?
</h3>

<p>
Aha, maybe there are bugs in the implementations, but none are confirmed now.
If the return results are unexpected, it is more possible that your expectations are not correct.
</p>

<div>
There are many trim functions in <code>strings</code> and <code>bytes</code> standard packages.
These functions can be categorized into two groups:
<ol>
<li>
	<code>Trim</code>, <code>TrimLeft</code>, <code>TrimRight</code>, <code>TrimSpace</code>, <code>TrimFunc</code>, <code>TrimLeftFunc</code>, <code>TrimRightFunc</code>.
	These functions will trim all leading or trailing UTF-8-encoded Unicode code points (a.k.a. runes)
	which satisfy the specified or implied conditions (<code>TrimSpace</code> implies to trim all kinds of white spaces).
	Each of the leading or trailing runes will be checked until one doesn't satisfy the specified or implied conditions.
</li>
<li>
	<code>TrimPrefix</code>, <code>TrimSuffix</code>.
	The two functions will trim the specified prefix or suffix substrings (or subslices) as a whole.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>
	Why aren't two <code>nil</code> values equal sometimes?
</h3>

<p><i>
(<a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#nil_error">The answer</a> in the official Go FAQ
may also answer this question.)
</i></p>

<div>
Before answering this question, let's look some facts in Go:
<ul>
<li>
	<code>nil</code> can be used as values of many types
	(pointers, slices, maps, channels, functions and interfaces).
</li>
<li>
	<code>nil</code> values may have no types (untyped).
</li>
<li>
	a non-interface typed value, which type is <code>T</code>,
	can be converted to an interface type <code>I</code>, if <code>T</code>
	implements <code>I</code>. A copy of the non-interface value will be
	stored in the interface value after the conversion.
</li>
<li>
	an interface value stores a non-interface value.
	The non-interface value is called the dynamic value of the interface value.
	The type info of the dynamic value is also stored in the interface value.
	The type of of the dynamic value is called the dynamic type of the interface value.
</li>
<li>
	untyped <code>nil</code> values can be converted to any
	type of pointers, slices, maps, channels, functions and interfaces.
</li>
<li>
	when an untyped <code>nil</code> value is stored in an interface value,
	the interface value has no dynamic type.
</li>
<li>
	if two non-interface values are comparable (at both compile time and run time), they must be equal.
</li>
<li>
	if one interface value and one non-interface value are comparable (at both compile time and run time),
	the non-interface value will be converted to the type of the interface value
	before the comparing.
	So comparing one interface value and one non-interface value
	is equivalent to comparing two interface values.
</li>
<li>
	if two interface values are comparable (at both compile time and run time), they are equal only if
	they have the same dynamic type and their dynamic values are equal.
</li>
</ul>

From these facts, we can get:
<ul>
<li>
	two interface values, which dynamic values are both <code>nil</code>,
	are not equal if their the dynamic types are different
	(or one has dynamic type but the other has not).
</li>
<li>
	an interface value, which dynamic value is <code>nil</code>,
	and a non-interface <code>nil</code> value are not equal
	if the dynamic type of the interface value is not the type
	of the non-interface <code>nil</code> value.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
	Why don't type <code>[]T1</code> and <code>[]T2</code> share the same underlying type
	even if the two different types <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> share the same underlying type?
</h3>

<p><i>
(It looks the official Go FAQ also added <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#convert_slice_with_same_underlying_type">a similar question</a> not long ago.)
</i></p>

<p>
In Go, values of a slice type can be converted to another slice type
without using the <code>unsafe</code> mechanisms only if the two slice types
share the same <a href="type-system-overview.html#underlying-type">underlying type</a>
(<a href="value-conversions-assignments-and-comparisons.html">this article</a>
lists the full list of value conversion rules).
</p>

<p>
The underlying type of an unnamed composite type is the composite type itself.
So even if two different types <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> share the same underlying type,
type <code>[]T1</code> and <code>[]T2</code> are still different types,
so their underlying types are also different, which means values of one of them can't be converted
to the other.
</p>

<div>
The reasons for the underlying types of <code>[]T1</code> and <code>[]T2</code> are not same are:
<ul>
<li>the request of converting values of <code>[]T1</code> and <code>[]T2</code> to each other is not common in practice.</li>
<li>to make <a href="type-system-overview.html#underlying-type">underlying type tracing rule</a> simpler.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The same reasons are also valid for other composite types.
For example, type <code>map[T]T1</code> and <code>map[T]T2</code> also don't share the same underlying type
even if <code>T1</code> and <code>T2</code> share the same underlying type.
</p>

<div>
It is possible that values of type <code>[]T1</code> can be converted to
<code>[]T2</code> by using the <code>unsafe</code> mechanisms,
but generally this is not recommended:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

func main() {
	type MyInt int
	
	var a = []int{7, 8, 9}
	var b = *(*[]MyInt)(unsafe.Pointer(&a))
	b[0]= 123
	fmt.Println(a) // [123 8 9]
	fmt.Println(b) // [123 8 9]
	fmt.Printf("%T \n", a) // []int
	fmt.Printf("%T \n", b) // []main.MyInt
}

<li>constant values</li>

<div class="alert alert-success">
Please note, there is a syntax sugar, <code>&T{}</code>, in Go.
It is a short form of <code>tmp := T{}; (&tmp)</code>.
So <code>&T{}</code> is legal doesn't mean
<code>T{}</code> is addressable.
</div>
<p></p>

<div>
Following values can be taken addresses:
<ul>
<li>variables</li>
<li>fields of addressable structs</li>
<li>elements of addressable arrays</li>

<li>pointer dereference operations</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="maps-are-unaddressable"></p>
<h3>
	Why are map elements unaddressable?
</h3>

<p>
The first reason is that, in Go, for a map <code>m</code> and a key value <code>k</code>,
the read operation <code>m[k]</code> is always valid, even if <code>m</code> is a <code>nil</code>
map or <code>m</code> doesn't contain the key <code>k</code>.
For the two circumstances, <code>m[k]</code> is always the zero value of the map element type.
The zero value of any type should be immutable.
Immutable values can't be taken addresses, otherwise their values may be modified.
Whether or not <code>m[k]</code> is a zero value can only be detected at run time.
So, to make it safe and consistent, Go compilers always think <code>m[k]</code> is unaddressable.
</p>

<p>
Another reason is making map elements addressable means the address of a map element
must not be changed in its life cycle. This prevents Go compilers using more efficient
algorithms to implement map. For the standard Go compiler, the internal addresses of
map elements may be changed at run time.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="slice-elements-always-addressable"></p>
<h3>
	Why elements of a non-nil slice are always addressable, even if the slice is unaddressable?
</h3>

<div>
The internal type for slices is a struct like
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">struct {
	elements unsafe.Pointer
	length   int
	capacity int
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Each slice indirectly references an element sequence.
Although a non-nil slice is not addressable, its internal element sequence must be addressable.
Taking addresses of elements of a slice is taking the addresses of elements of the internal array, in fact.
This is why elements of unaddressable non-nil slices are addressable.
</p>
</div>

<p>
For the same reason, the substring operations on unaddressable strings also always compile ok
(by the standard Go compiler).
However, I can't make sure whether this is guaranteed by Go specification or not.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="method-set-relation"></p>
<h3>
	For any non-pointer non-interface defined type <code>T</code>,
	why is the method set of <code>*T</code> always a super set of the method set of <code>T</code>,
	but not vice versa?
</h3>

<div>
In Go, for convenience,
<ul>
<li>
	a value of type <code>T</code>  can call methods defined on type <code>*T</code>,
	only if the value of <code>T</code> are addressable.
	Compilers will take the address of the <code>T</code> value automatically
	before calling the pointer methods.
	For not any values of type <code>T</code> are addressable,
	not any values of type <code>T</code> are capable of calling methods defined on type <code>*T</code>.
	<div>This convenience is just a sugar, not an intrinsic rule.</div>
</li>
<li>
	a value of type <code>*T</code>  can always call methods defined on type <code>T</code>.
	This is because it is always legal to dereference a pointer value.
	<div>This convenience is not only a sugar, but also an intrinsic rule.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
So it is much reasonable that the method set of <code>*T</code> is always
a super set of the method set of <code>T</code>, but not vice versa.
</p>
</div>

<div>
In fact, you can think for every method defined on type <code>T</code>,
an implicit method with the same name and the same signature is automatically
defined on type <code>*T</code>:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func (t T) MethodX(param0 ParamType0, ...) (result0 ResultType0, ...) {
	...
}

// An implicit method of *T is automatically defined as
func (pt *T) MethodX(param0 ParamType0, ...) (result0 ResultType0, ...) {
	return (*pt).MethodX(param0, ...)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
If a method is defined on type <code>*T</code>, no methods with the same method name can
be defined on <code>T</code> any more.
This is another explanation why the method set of <code>*T</code> is always
a super set of the method set of <code>T</code>, but not vice versa.

<h3>
	How to declare immutable values in Go?
</h3>

<div>
There are three <b><i>immutable value</i></b> definitions:
<ol>
<li>the values which have no addresses (so they are not addressable).</li>
<li>the values which have addresses but are not addressable (their addresses are not allowed to be taken in syntax).</li>
<li>the values which are addressable but their values are not allowed to be modified in syntax.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In Go, up to now (Go 10), there are no values satisfy the third definition.
In other words, the third definition is not supported.
</p>

<p>
Part of the values satisfy the first definition in Go are called <b><i>constants</i></b>.
In Go, only bool, numeric and string values can be declared as constants.
</p>

<p>
Methods and package-level functions can also viewed as declared immutable values.
They satisfy the second definition.
</p>

<p>
There are no ways to declare other custom immutable values in Go.

<h3>
	Why isn't there a built-in <code>set</code> type?

</p>

<p>
A <code>rune</code> often is used to store a Unicode break point.

<h3>
	Why isn't there a built-in <code>closed</code> function to check whether or not a channel is closed?

The reason is the usefulness of such function is very limited.
The return result of a call to such function may be not able to
reflect the latest status of the input channel.
So it is not a good idea to make decisions relying on the return result.

<p>
Go compilers which support stack will do escape analysis.
For the standard Go compiler, if the escape analyzer thinks a memory block
will only be used in current function call for sure, it will allocate the
memory block on stack, otherwise, then the memory block will be allocated on heap.
