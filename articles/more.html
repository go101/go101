<p>
Go 101 articles are mainly focus on syntaxes and semantics in Go.
There are some other Go related knowledges are not covered in Go 101.
The remaining of the current article will make simple introductions
for those knowledges and provide some web links for readers to digg
more on them.
</p>

<h3>Tests And Benchmarks</h3>

<div>
We can use the official SDK <code>go test</code> command to run tests and benchmarks.
Test source file names must end with <code>_test.go</code>.
Please read the following articles on how to write tests and benchmarks and run them.
<ul>
<li>
	<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing/">package testing</a>.
</li>
<li>
	<a href="https://blog.golang.org/subtests">Using Subtests and Sub-benchmarks</a>.
</li>
<li>
	<a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Test_packages"><code>go test</code> command options</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3>gccgo</h3>

<p>
<b>gccgo</b> is another Go compiler maintained by Go design team.
It is mainly used to verify the correctness of the standard Go compiler (<b>gc</b>).
We can use the <code>-compiler=gccgo</code> build option in several official Go SDK
commands to use the gccgo compiler instead of the gc compiler.
For example, <code>go run -compiler=gccgo main.go</code>.
On Linux, we can also install the "gccgo" package to use the gccgo comppiler.
</p>

<p>
More build options are <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_packages_and_dependencies">listed here</a>.
All subcommands of the <code>go</code> commands are also explained in that article.
</p>

<h3>Go Assembly</h3>

<p>
Functions can be implemented with Go assembly language.
Go assembly language is a cross-architectures (though not 100%) assembly language.
Go assembly language is often used to implement some functions
which are critical for Go program execution performances.
<p>

</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3>cgo</h3>

<div>
We can call C code from Go code, and vice versa, through the cgo mechanism.
Please follow the following links for details.
<ul>
<li>
	<a href="https://blog.golang.org/c-go-cgo">C? Go? Cgo!</a>
</li>
<li>
	<a href="https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/">Command cgo</a>
</li>
<li>
	<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/cgo">cgo</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is possible to use C++ libraries through cgo.
</p>

<p>
Please note that using cgo in code may make it is hard to maintain
cross-platform compatibility of Go pprograms,
and the calls between Go and C code are much less efficient than Go-Go and C-C calls.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Cross-Platform Compiling</h3>

<div>
The standard Go compiler supports cross-platform compiling.
By setting the <code>GOOS</code> and <code>GOARCH</code> enviroments
before running the <code>go build</code> command, 
we can build a Windows executable on a Linux machine, and vice versa.
Please read the following articles for details.
<ul>
<li>
	<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WindowsCrossCompiling">Building windows go programs on linux</a>.
</li>
<li>
	<a href="https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment">The current supported target operating systems and compilation architectures</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>Build Constraints (Tags)</h3>

<p>
We can use <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/go/build/">build constraints</a>
to let compilers build source files selectively.
A build constraint is called called a build tag.
A build constraint can appear as a comment line like <code>// +build constraints</code>
or appear as the suffix in the base name of a soruce file.
</p>

<h3>Compiler Directives</h3>

<p>
The standard Go compiler supports several
<a href="https://golang.org/cmd/compile/#hdr-Compiler_Directives">compiler directives</a>.
A directive appears as a comment line like <code>//directive args</code>.
The most used compiler directive in practice may be the
<a href="https://blog.golang.org/generate">go:generate</a> directive.
</p>

<h3>System Calls</h3>

<p>
We can make system calls by call the functions exported by the
<code>syscall</code> standard package.
Please beware that, different from other standard packages,
the functions in the <code>syscall</code> standard package are operating system dependent.
</p>

<h3>The <code>go/*</code> Standard Packages</h3>

<p>
The <code>go/*</code> standard packages provide functionalities of
parsing Go source files, which are very useful to write custom Go tools.
Please read <a href="https://github.com/golang/example/tree/master/gotypes"><code>go/types</code>: The Go Type Checker</a>
and <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/go/">package documentations</a> for how to use these packages.
</p>

<h3>More Build Targets</h3>

<p>
The <code>go build</code> command in the official Go SDK supports several build modes.
Please run <code>go help buildmode</code> to show the available build modes
or read the explanations for <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Build_modes">-buildmode option</a> instead.
Except the <b>default</b> build mode, the most used build mode may be the <b>plugin</b> build mode.
We can use the functions in <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/">the <code>plugin</code> standard package</a>
to load and use the outputted Go plugin files by using the <b>plugin</b> build mode.
</p>
