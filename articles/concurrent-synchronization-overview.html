<h1>Concurrency Synchronization Overview</h1>

<p>
This article will explain what are synchronizations
and list the synchronization techniques supported by Go.
</p>

<h3>What Are Synchronizations?</h3>

<div>
<p>
Often, at run time, in a concurrent program,
a value will be accessed by multiple goroutines.
For such circumstances, we must control which goroutines
can accquire the ownership of the value at a given time.
Otherwise, data races may happen and the integrity of the value will not get guaranteed.
</p>

<p>
We use all kinds of data synchronization techniques to transfer ownerships
of values among goroutines to avoid data races in current programs. 
</p>

Here, more specifically, about the ownership of a value,
<ul>
<li>
	the write ownership of a value is exclusive.
	In the period of a goroutine owns the write right of a value,
	no other goroutines should access the value, either read or write.
</li>
<li>
	the read ownership of a value is non-exclusive.
	In the period of a goroutine owns the read right of a value,
	other goroutines can also safely read the value,
	but no goroutines should write the value.
</li>
</ul>

<p><i>
(In fact, more precisely, to avoid data races,
what we care about is the ownerships of some memmory segments.
At run time, a value may occupy multiple memmory segments.
We might not care about the ownerships of all the memmory segments
occupied by a value in writing a piece of concurrent code.
But, for explanation simplicity, we will still use
the "ownerships of values" wording in descriptions throughout Go 101 articles.)

<h3>What Synchronization Techniques Does Go Support?</h3>

<div>
The article <a href="goroutine-and-channel-introduction.html">goroutine and channel introduction</a>
has shown that we can channels to do synchronizations.
Besides channels, Go also supports some other common synchronization techniques,
such as mutex and atomic operations.
Please read the following articles to get how to do synchronizations
with all kinds of techniques in Go:

<li><a href="concurrent-atomic-operation.html">Atomic Operations Provided In The <code>sync/atomic</code> Standard Package</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
We can also do synchronizations by making use of network and file IO.
But such techniques are very inefficient whthin a single program process.
Generally, they are used for inter-process and distributed synchronizations.
Go 101 will not cover such techniques.
</p>

<p>
Data synchronization techniques will not prevent you from writing
<a href="concurrent-common-mistakes.html">improper concurrent code</a>.
However the techniques provided by Go can help you write correct concurrent code easily.
And the unique channel features make concurrent programming flexiable and enjoyable.

<p>
To understand these synchronization techniques better,
it is recommended to know the <a href="memory-model.html">memory order guarantees in Go</a>.
