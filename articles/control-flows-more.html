<h1>Goroutines, Deferred Function Calls And Panic/Recover</h1>

<p>
This article will introduce goroutines and deferred function calls.
Goroutine and deferred function call are two unique features in Go.
Panic and recover mechanism will also be simply explained in this article.
Not all knowledges relating to the these features are convered in the
current article, other ones will be introduced in other articles later.
</p>

<h3>Goroutines</h3>

<p>
Goroutines are also often called green threads.
Green threads are maintained and scheduled by
language runtime instead of operation systems.
The cost, such as memory consumption and context switching,
of a goroutine is much smaller than an OS thread.
So it is not a problem for a Go program to maintain tons of thousand
goroutines at the same time, as long as the system memory is sufficient.
</p>

<p>
Go doesn't support creating system threads in user code.
So using goroutines is the only way to do concurrent programing
(program scope) in Go.
</p>

<p>
Each Go program starts with only one goroutine,
we call it the main goroutine, at the beginning.
A goroutine can create new goroutines.
It is super easy to create a new goroutine in Go,
just make a function call follow a <code>go</code> keyword,
then the function call will be executed in a new created goroutine.
The new created goroutine will exit alongside the exit of the called function.
</p>

<div>
All the result values of a goroutine function call
(if the called function has return results)
must be discarded in the function call statement.
The following is an example which creates two new goroutines
in the main goroutine.
In the example, <code>time.Duration</code> is a custom type defined
in the <code>time</code> standard package.
It is defined as the built-in type <code>int64</code>.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"log"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

func SayGreetings(greeting string, times int) {
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		log.Println(greeting)
		d := time.Second * time.Duration(rand.Intn(5)) / 2
		time.Sleep(d)
	}
}

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
	log.SetFlags(0)
	go SayGreetings("hi!", 10)
	go SayGreetings("hello!", 10)
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
}
</code></pre>

Quite easy. Right? We do concurrent programming now!
The above program will have three user created goroutines running
simultaneously at its peak at run time.
Let's run it. One possible output result:

<pre class="output"><code>hi!
hello!
hello!
hello!
hello!
hi!
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
When the main goroutine exits, the whole program also exits.
</p>

<p>
Unlike previous articles, this program uses the <code>Println</code>
function in the <code>log</code> standard package instead of the
corresponding function in the <code>fmt</code> standard package.
The reason is the print functions in the <code>log</code> standard
package are synchronized, so the texts printed by the two goroutines
will not be messed up in one line (though the chance the printed texts
being messed up by using the print functions in the <code>fmt</code>
standard package is low for this specified program).
</p>

</div>

<h3>Concurrency Synchronization</h3>

<div>
<p>
The above program is not perfect.
The two new goroutines are intended to print ten greetings each.
However, the main goroutine will exit in two seconds,
so many greatings have not a chance to get printed.
How to let the main goroutine know when the two new goroutines
have both finished their tasks?
We must use some a concurrency synchronization technique.
</p>

<p>
Go supports several
<a href="concurrent-synchronization-overview.html">concurrency synchronization
techniques</a>. Among these techniques,
<a href="channel.html">channel</a> is the most unique and popularly used one.
However, here will use one another technique,
the <code>WaitGroup</code> type in the <code>sync</code> standard package,
to do synchronizations between the two new goroutines and the main goroutine.
</p>

<p>
The <code>WaitGroup</code> type has three methods, <code>Add</code>,
<code>Done</code> and <code>Wait</code>.
This type will be explained detailedly later in another article.
Here we can simply think the <code>Add</code> method is used to register
number of new tasks, the <code>Done</code> method is used to notify
that a task is finished, and the <code>Wait</code> method makes the caller
goroutine become blocking until all registered tasks are finished.
</p>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"log"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
	"sync"
)

var wg sync.WaitGroup

func SayGreetings(greeting string, times int) {
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		log.Println(greeting)
		d := time.Second * time.Duration(rand.Intn(5)) / 2
		time.Sleep(d)
	}
	wg.Done() // notify a task is finished.
}

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
	log.SetFlags(0)
	wg.Add(2) // register two tasks.
	go SayGreetings("hi!", 10)
	go SayGreetings("hello!", 10)
	wg.Wait() // block until all tasks are finished.
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Run it, we can find that, before the program exits,
each of the two new goroutines prints ten greetings.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Goroutine States</h3>

<div>
<p>
The last example shows that a live goroutine may stay in (and switch between)
two states, <b>running</b> and <b>blocking</b>.
In that example, the main goroutine enters the blocking state when the
<code>wg.Wait</code> method is called, and enter running state again
when the other two goroutines both finish their respective tasks.
</p>

<p>
A goroutine in sleeping (by calling <code>time.Sleep</code> function)
or waiting the response of a syscall or a netword connnection
is viewed as staying in running state.
</p>

<p>
When a new goroutine is created, it will enter running state automatically.
Goroutines can only exit from running state, and never from blocking state.
If, for any reason, a goroutine stays in blokcing state for ever,
then it will never exit.
Such case should be avoided in concurrent programming,
if it happens, it causes memory leak and should be viewed as a logic bug.
</p>

<p>
A blocking goroutine can only be unblocked by
an operation made in another goroutine.
If all goroutines in a Go program are in blocking state,
then all of they will stay in blocking state for ever.
This can be viewed as an overall deadlock.
When this happens in a program, the standard Go runtime
will try to crash the program.
</p>

The following program will ctash, after two seconds:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"sync"
	"time"
)

var wg sync.WaitGroup

func main() {
	wg.Add(1)
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)
		wg.Wait()
	}()
	wg.Wait()
}
</code></pre>

The output:
<pre class="output"><code>fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!

...
</code></pre>

<p>
Later, we will learn more operations which will make goroutines
enter blocking state.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Goroutine Schedule</h3>

<p>
We can call the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#NumCPU"><code>runtime.NumCPU</code></a>
function to get the number of logical CPUs avaliable for the current running program.
The number of live running goroutines may be much larger than the number of logical CPUs.
Each logical CPU can only execute one goroutine at any given time.
Go runtime must frequently switches execution contexts between goroutines
to let each running goroutine have chances to execute.
This is similar to how operation systems switch execution contexts between OS threads.
</p>

<p>
The standard Go runtime adopts the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TTj4T2JO42uD5ID9e89oa0sLKhJYD0Y_kqxDv3I3XMw">M-P-G model</a>
to do the goroutine schedule job,
where <b>M</b> represents OS threads,
<b>P</b> represents logical/virtual processors (not logical CPUs)
and <b>G</b> represents goroutines.
Most the schedule work is made by logical processors (<b>P</b>s),
which act as brokers by attach goroutines (<b>G</b>s) to OS threads (<b>M</b>s).
Each OS thread can only be attached to most one goroutine at any given time,
and each goroutine can only be attached to most one OS thread at any given time.
A goroutine can only get executed when it is attached to an OS thread.
A goroutine which has been executed for a while will try to detach itself from the corresponding OS thread,
so that other running goroutines can have chances to get attached and executed.
</p>

<p>
At runtime. we can call the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#GOMAXPROCS"><code>runtime.GOMAXPROCS</code></a>
function to get and set the number of logical processors (<b>P</b>s).
For the standard Go runtime, before Go 1.5, the default value of this number is <code>1</code>,
but since Go 1.5, the default initial value of this number is equal to
the number of logical CPUs avaiable for the current running program.
The default initial value (the number of logical CPUs) is the best choice for most programs.
The default initial value can also be set through the <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> environment variable.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="defer"></p>
<h3>Deferred Function Calls</h3>

<div>
<p>
A deferred function call is a function call which follows a <code>defer</code> keyword.
Like goroutine function calls,
all the result values of the function call (if the called function has return results)
must be discarded in the function call statement.
</p>

<p>
When a function call is deferred, it is not executed immediately.
It will be push into a defer-call stack maintained by its caller goroutine.
When a function call <code>fc</code> returns and enters its exiting phase,
all the deferred function calls pushed in the function call (<code>fc</code>)
(which has not exited yet) will be executed,
by their inverse orders being pushed into the defer-call stack.
Once all these deferred calls are executed,
the function call <code>fc</code> exits.
</p>

Here is a simple example to show how to use deferred function calls.
In the example, <code>defer</code> are keywords.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	defer fmt.Println("The third line.")
	defer fmt.Println("The second line.")
	fmt.Println("The first line.")
}
</code></pre>

The output:
<pre class="output"><code>The first line.
The second line.
The third line.
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

Each goroutine maintain two call stacks,
the normal-call stack and defer-call stack.
<ul>
<li>
	For two adjacent function calls in the normal-call stack of a goroutine,
	The later pushed one is called by the earlier pushed one.
	The bottom function call in the normal-call stack is the function call
	following the <code>go</code> keyword.
</li>
<li>
	The functions calls in the defer-call stack have no calling relations.
</li>
</ul>

Here is another example which is a little more complex.
The example will print <code>0</code> to <code>9</code>,
each per line, by their natural order.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	defer fmt.Println("9")
	fmt.Println("0")
	defer fmt.Println("8")
	fmt.Println("1")
	if false {
		defer fmt.Println("not reachable")
	}
	defer func() {
		defer fmt.Println("7")
		fmt.Println("3")
		defer func() {
			fmt.Println("5")
			fmt.Println("6")
		}()
		fmt.Println("4")
	}()
	fmt.Println("2")
	return
	defer fmt.Println("not reachable")
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="defer-modify-resutls"></p>
<h3>Deferred Anonymous Functions Can Modify The Named Return Results Of Nesting Functions</h3>

<div>
For example,
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func Triple(n int) (r int) {
	defer func() {
		r += n // modify the return value
	}()
	
	return n + n // <=> r = n + n; return
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Triple(5)) // 15
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>The Necessary And Benefits Of The Defered Function Feature</h3>

<p>
In the above examples, the deferred function calls are not absolutely necessary.
However, the deferred function call feature is a necessary feature for the
panic and recover mechanism which will be introduced below.
</p>

<p>
Deferred function calls can also help us write more clean and robust code.
We can read more code examples by using deferred functtion calls
and learn more details on deferred function cals in the article
<a href="defer-more.html">more about deferred functions</a> later.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="argument-evaluation-moment"></p>
<h3>The Evaluation Moment Of The Arguments Of Deferred And Goroutine Function Calls</h3>

<div>
The arguments of a deferred function call or a goroutine function call are all
evaluated at the moment when the function call is invoked.
<ul>
<li>
	For a deferred function call, the invocation moment is the moment
	when it is pushed into the defer-call stack of its caller goroutine.
</li>
<li>
	For a goroutine function call, the invocation moment is
	the moment when the corresponding goroutine is created.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The arguments of each function call nested in a deferred function call
or a goroutine function call are evaluated at the moment when that nested
function call is invoked.
</p>

Here is an example.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	func() {
		for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
			defer fmt.Println("a:", i)
		}
	}()
	fmt.Println()
	func() {
		for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
			defer func() {
				fmt.Println("b:", i)
			}()
		}
	}()
}
</code></pre>

Run it. The output:
<pre class="output"><code>a: 2
a: 1
a: 0

b: 3
b: 3
b: 3
</code></pre>

<p>
The first loop prints <code>i</code> as <code>2</code>, <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> as a sequence.
The second loop always prints <code>i</code> as <code>3</code>,
for when the three <code>fmt.Println</code> calls in the deferred anonymous calls are invoked,
the value of the loop variable <code>i</code> has become to <code>3</code>.
</p>

The same argument valuation moment rules for goroutine function calls.
The following program will output <code>123 789</code>.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "time"

func main() {
	var a = 123
	go func(x int) {
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		fmt.Println(x, a) // 123 789
	}(a)
	
	a = 789
	
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
By the way, it is not a good idea to do synchronizations by using
<code>time.Sleep</code> calls.
If the program runs on a computor which CPUs are occupied by many other
programs running on the computer, the new created goroutine may never
get chances to execute before the program exits.
We should use the concurrency synchronization techniques introduced in the article
<a href="concurrent-synchronization-overview.html">concurrency synchronization overview</a>
to do synchronizations in formal projects.
</p>

</div>

<p class="anchor" id="panic-recover"></p>
<h3>Panic And Recover</h3>

<p>
Go doesn't support exception throwing, instead,
explicit error handling is preferred to use in Go programming.
However, in fact, Go supports an exception throw/catch alike mechanism.
The mechanism is called panic/recover.
</p>

<p>
We can call the built-in <code>panic</code> function to create a panic
to make the current goroutine enter panicking status.
The panic is only alive within the current goroutine.
There may be multiple panics coexisting in a goroutine.
</p>

<p>
Panics can be recovered by using the built-in <code>recover</code> function.
Once all panics in a goroutine are recovered,
the goroutine will enter normal calm status again.
<p>

<p>
Panicking is another way to make a function return.
One a panic shows in a function call, the function call returns immediately
and enter its exiting phase. The deferred function calls pushed in the
function call will get executed, by their inverse orders being pushed.
A <code>recover</code> function can only recover the panic
if it is called in one of the deferred function call.
</p>

<p>
If a panicking goroutine exits without being recovered,
it will make the whole program crash.
</p>

The built-in <code>panic</code> and <code>recover</code> functions are
declared as
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func panic(v interface{})
func recover() interface{}
</code></pre>

<p>
Interface types and values will be explained in the article
<a href="interface.html">interfaces in Go</a> later.
Here, we just need to know that the blank interface type
<code>interface{}</code> can be viewed as the <code>any</code> type
or the <code>Object</code> type in many other languages. In other words,
we can pass a value of any type to a <code>panic</code> function call.
</p>

<p>
The value returned by a <code>recover</code> function call is the value
a <code>panic</code> function call consumed.
</p>

Here is an example shows how to create a panic and how to recover the panic.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("hi!")
	defer func() {
		v := recover()
		fmt.Println("recovered:", v)
	}()
	panic("bye!")
	fmt.Println("unreachable")
}
</code></pre>

The output:

<pre class="output"><code>hi!
recovered: bye!
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

Here is another example shows a panicking goroutine exits without being recovered.
So the whole program crashes.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("hi!")
	
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		panic(123)
	}()
	
	for {
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
	}
}
</code></pre>

The output:

<pre class="output"><code>hi!
panic: 123

goroutine 5 [running]:
...
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

Go runtime will create panics for many circumstances,
such as dividing an integer by zero. For example,

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	a, b := 1, 0
	_ = a/b
}
</code></pre>

The output:

<pre class="output"><code>panic: runtime error: integer divide by zero

goroutine 1 [running]:
...
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
More runtime panic circumstances will be mentioned
in other later Go 101 articles.
</p>

<p>
We can learn <a href="panic-and-recover-use-cases.html">some panic/recover use cases</a>
and <a href="panic-and-recover-more.html">more about panic and recover mechanism</a> later.
</p>

<h3>Some Fatal Errors Are Not Panics And Unrecoverable</h3>

<p>
For the standard Go compiler, some fatal errors,
such as stack overflow and out of memory, are not panics.
They are not recoverable.
Once they occur, program will crash.
</p>
