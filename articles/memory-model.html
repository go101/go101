<h1>Memory Order Guarantees in Go</h1>

<h3>About Memory Ordering</h3>

<p>
Many compilers (at compile time) and CPU processors (at run time)
often make some optimizations by adjusting the instruction orders,
so that the instruction execution orders may differ from the
orders presented in code.
Instruction ordering is also often called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_ordering">memory ordering</a>.
</p>

<p>
Surely, instruction reordering can't be arbitrary.
The basic requirement for a reordering inside a specified goroutine is
the reordering must not be detectable by the goroutine itself
if the goroutine doesn't share data with other goroutines.
In other words, from the perspective of such a goroutine,
it can think its instruction execution order is always
the same as the order specified by code,
even if instruction reordering really happens inside it.
</p>

<p>
However, if some goroutines share some data,
then instruction reordering happens inside one of these goroutine
may be observed by the others goroutines,
and affect the behaviors of all these goroutines.
Sharing data between goroutines is common in concurrent programming.
If we ignore the results caused by instruction reordering,
the behaviors of our concurrent programs might compiler and CPU dependent,
and often abnormal.
</p>

<div>
Here is an unprofessional Go program which doesn't consider instruction reordering.
the program is expanded from an example in the official documentation
<a href="https://golang.org/ref/mem">Go 1 memory model</a>.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "log"
import "runtime"

var a string
var done bool

func setup() {
	a = "hello, world"
	done = true
	if done {
		log.Println(len(a)) // always 12 once printed
	}
}

func main() {
	go setup()

	for !done {
		runtime.Gosched()
	}
	log.Println(a) // expected to print: hello, world
}
</code></pre>

The behavior of this program is very possible as we expect,
a <code>hello, world</code> text will be printed.
However, the behavior of this program is compiler and CPU dependent.
If the program is compiled with a different compiler,
or with a later compiler version, or it runs on a different architecture,
the <code>hello, world</code> text might not be printed,
or a text different from <code>hello, world</code> might be printed.
The reason is compilers and CPUs may exchange the execution orders of
the first two lines in the <code>setup</code> function,
so the final effect of the <code>setup</code> function may become to
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func setup() {
	done = true
	a = "hello, world"
	if done {
		log.Println(len(a))
	}
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
The <code>setup</code> goroutine in the above program is unable to observe the reordering,
so the <code>log.Println(len(a))</code> line will always print <code>12</code>
(if this line gets executed before the program exits).
However, the main goroutine may observe the reordering,
which is why the printed text might be not <code>hello, world</code>.
</p>

<p>
Besides the problem of ignoring memory reordering, there are data races in the program.
There are not any synchronizations made in using the variable
<code>a</code> and <code>done</code>.
So, the above program is a showcase full of concurrent programming mistakes.
A professional Go programmer should not make these mistakes.
</p>

<p>
We can use the <code>go build -race</code> command provided in Go SDK
to build a program, then we can run the outputted executable to check
whether or not there are data races in the program.
</p>

<h3>Go Memory Model</h3>

<p>
Sometimes, we need to ensure that the execution of some code lines in a goroutine
must happen before (or after) the execution of some code lines in another goroutine
(from the view of either of the two goroutines),
to keep the correctness of a program.
Instruction reordering may cause some troubles for such circumstances.
How should we do to prevent certain possible instruction reordering?
</p>

<p>
Different CPU architectures provide different fence instructions
to prevent different kinds of instruction reordering.
Some programming languages provide corresponding functions
to insert these fence instructions in code.
However, understanding and correctly using the fence instructions
raises the bar of concurrent programming.
</p>

<p>
The design philosophy of Go is to use as fewer features as possible
to support as more use cases as possible, at the same time to
ensure a good enough overall code execution efficiency.
So Go built-in and standard packages don't provide direct ways
to use the CPU fence instructions.
In fact, CPU fence instructions are used in implementing all kinds of synchronization techniques supported in Go.
So, we should use these synchronization techniques to ensure expected code execution orders.
</p>

<p>
The remaining of the current article will list some guaranteed (and non-guaranteed) code execution orders in Go,
which are mentioned or not mentioned in
<a href="https://golang.org/ref/mem">Go 1 memory model</a> and other official Go documentations.
</p>

<p>
In the following descriptions, if we say
event <code>A</code> is guaranteed to happen before event <code>B</code>,
it means any of the goroutines involved in the two events will observe that
any of the statements presented before event <code>A</code> in source code
will be executed before
any of the statements presented after event <code>B</code> in source code.
For other irrelevant goroutines,
the observed orders may be different from the just described.
</p>

<h4><code>init</code> functions related order guarantees</h4>

<div>
The execution order of the <code>init</code> functions in a program order guarantees:

The article <a href="packages-and-imports.html#initialization-order">code packages and package imports</a>
has introduced the execution order of the <code>init</code> functions in a program.
Here lists the guaranteed orders:
<ul>
<li>
	The completion of all the <code>init</code> functions in the dependency packages of a package
	happens before the start of any <code>init</code> function in the package.
</li>
<li>
	The completion of all <code>init</code> functions in a program
	happens before the start of the program <code>main</code> entry function.
</li>
</ul>

In fact, there are two other order guarantees:
<ul>
<li>
	the completion of all package-level variable initializations in a package
	happens before the start of any <code>init</code> function in the package.
</li>
<li>
	the completion of all the <code>init</code> functions in the dependency packages of a package
	happens before any package-level variable initialization in the package.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Package loading only involves one goroutine.
</p>

</div>
-->

<a class="anchor" id="goroutine"></a>
<h4>The creation of a goroutine happens before the execution of the goroutine</h4>

<div>
In the following function,
the assignment <code>x, y = 123, 789</code> will be executed before the call <code>fmt.Println(x)</code>,
and the call <code>fmt.Println(x)</code> will be executed before the call <code>fmt.Println(y)</code>.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">var x, y int
func f1() {
	x, y = 123, 789
	go func() {
		fmt.Println(x)
		go func() {
			fmt.Println(y)
		}()
	}()
}
</code></pre>

However, the execution orders of the three in the following function are not deterministic.
There are data races in this function.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">var x, y int
func f2() {
	go func() {
		// Might print 0, 123, or some others.
		fmt.Println(x)
	}()
	go func() {
		// Might print 0, 789, or some others.
		fmt.Println(y)
	}()
	x, y = 123, 789
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<a class="anchor" id="channel"></a>
<h4>Channel operations related order guarantees</h4>

<div>

<!--
The following listed guarantees are not mentioned in Go 1 memory model,
but I think they are obvious.
<ul>
<li>
	A channel send operation happens before the completion of the send operation.
</li>
<li>
	A channel receive operation happens before the completion of the receive operation.
</li>
<li>
	The completions of two send operations on a channel can't happen at the same time.
</li>
<li>
	The completions of two receive operations on a channel can't happen at the same time.
</li>
</ul>
-->

Go 1 memory model lists the following three channel related order guarantees.
<ol>
<li>
	The <b><i>n</i></b>th successful send to a channel happens before
	the <b><i>n</i></b>th successful receive from that channel completes,
	no matter that channel is buffered or unbuffered.
</li>
<li>
	The <b><i>n</i></b>th successful receive from a channel with capacity <b><i>m</i></b>
	happens before the (<b><i>n+m</i></b>)th successful send to that channel completes.
	In particular, if that channel is unbuffered (<code>m == 0</code>),
	the <b><i>n</i></b>th successful receive from that channel happens
	before the <b><i>n</i></b>th successful send on that channel completes.
</li>
<li>
	The closing of a channel happens before a receive completes if
	the receive returns a zero value because the channel is closed.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
In fact, the completion of the <b><i>n</i></b>th successful send to a channel and
the completion of the <b><i>n</i></b>th successful receive from the same channel
are the same event.
</p>

Here is an example show some guaranteed code execution orders
in using an unbuffered channel.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func f3() {
	var a, b int
	var c = make(chan bool)

	go func() {
		a = 1
		c <- true
		if b != 1 { // impossible
			panic("b != 1") // will never happen
		}
	}()

	go func() {
		b = 1
		<-c
		if a != 1  { // impossible
			panic("a != 1") // will never happen
		}
	}()
}
</code></pre>

Here, for the two new created goroutines, the following orders are guaranteed:
<ul>
<li>
	the execution of the assignment <code>b = 1</code> absolutely ends
	before the evaluation of the condition <code>b != 1</code>.
</li>
<li>
	the execution of the assignment <code>a = 1</code> absolutely ends
	before the evaluation of the condition <code>a != 1</code>.
</li>
</ul>

So the two calls to <code>panic</code> in the above example will never get executed.
However, the <code>panic</code> calls in the following example may get executed.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func f4() {
	var a, b, x, y int
	c := make(chan bool)

	go func() {
		a = 1
		c <- true
		x = 1
	}()

	go func() {
		b = 1
		<-c
		y = 1
	}()

	// Many data races are in this goroutine.
	// Don't write code as such.
	go func() {
		if x == 1 {
			if a != 1 { // possible
				panic("a != 1") // may happen
			}
			if b != 1 { // possible
				panic("b != 1") // may happen
			}
		}

		if y == 1 {
			if a != 1 { // possible
				panic("a != 1") // may happen
			}
			if b != 1 { // possible
				panic("b != 1") // may happen
			}
		}
	}()
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Here, for the third goroutine,
which is irrelevant to the operations on channel <code>c</code>.
It will not be guaranteed to observe the orders observed by the first two new created goroutines.
So, any of the four <code>panic</code> calls may get executed.
</p>

<p>
In fact, most compiler implementations do guarantee the four <code>panic</code> calls
in the above example will never get executed,
however, none of the Go official documentations make such guarantees.
So the code in the above example is not cross-compiler or cross-compiler-version compatible.
We should stick to the Go official documentations to write professional Go code.
</p>

Here is an example using a buffered channel.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func f5() {
	var k, l, m, n, x, y int
	c := make(chan bool, 2)

	go func() {
		k = 1
		c <- true
		l = 1
		c <- true
		m = 1
		c <- true
		n = 1
	}()

	go func() {
		x = 1
		<-c
		y = 1
	}()
}
</code></pre>

The following orders are guaranteed:
<ul>
<li>
	the execution of <code>k = 1</code> ends before
	the execution of <code>y = 1</code>.
</li>
<li>
	the execution of <code>x = 1</code> ends before
	the execution of <code>n = 1</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, the execution of <code>x = 1</code> is not guaranteed to happen before
the execution of <code>l = 1</code> and <code>m = 1</code>,
and the execution of <code>l = 1</code> and <code>m = 1</code>
is not guaranteed to happen before the execution of <code>y = 1</code>.
</p>

The following is an example on channel closing.
In this example, the execution of <code>k = 1</code>
is guaranteed to end before the execution of <code>y = 1</code>,
but not guaranteed to end before the execution of <code>x = 1</code>,
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func f6() {
	var k, x, y int
	c := make(chan bool, 1)

	go func() {
		c <- true
		k = 1
		close(c)
	}()

	go func() {
		<-c
		x = 1
		<-c
		y = 1
	}()
}
</code></pre>

<!--
The two guarantees may be not true.

There are two other obvious channel related order guarantees.
But they are not very valuable for Go programming in practice.
<ol>
<li>
	The completion of the <b>n</b>th successful send on a channel happens before
	the completion of the (<b>n+1</b>)th successful send on the channel.
</li>
<li>
	The completion of the <b>n</b>th successful receive on a channel happens before
	the completion of the (<b>n+1</b>)th successful receive on the channel.
</li>
</ol>
-->

</div>

<a class="anchor" id="mutex"></a>
<h4>Mutex related order guarantees</h4>

<div>
The followings are the mutex related order guarantees in Go.
<ol>
<li>
	For an addressable value <code>m</code> of type <code>Mutex</code> or <code>RWMutex</code>
	in the <code>sync</code> standard package, the <b><i>n</i></b>th successful
	<code>m.Unlock()</code> method call happens before the (<b><i>n+1</i></b>)th
	<code>m.Lock()</code> method call returns.
</li>
<li>
	For an addressable value <code>rw</code> of type <code>RWMutex</code>,
	if its <b><i>n</i></b>th <code>rw.Lock()</code> method call has returned,
	then its successful <b><i>n</i></b>th <code>rw.Unlock()</code> method call happens
	before the return of any <code>rw.RLock()</code> method call which is guaranteed
	to happen after the <b><i>n</i></b>th <code>rw.Lock()</code> method call returns.
</li>
<li>
	For an addressable value <code>rw</code> of type <code>RWMutex</code>,
	if its <b><i>n</i></b>th <code>rw.RLock()</code> method call has returned,
	then its <b><i>m</i></b>th successful <code>rw.RUnlock()</code> method call,
	where <code>m &lt;= n</code>, happens before the return of any
	<code>rw.Lock()</code> method call which is guaranteed to happen
	after the <b><i>n</i></b>th <code>rw.RLock()</code> method call returns.
</li>
</ol>

In the following example, the following orders are guaranteed:
<ul>
<li>
	the execution of <code>a = 1</code> ends before
	the execution of <code>b = 1</code>.
</li>
<li>
	the execution of <code>m = 1</code> ends before
	the execution of <code>n = 1</code>.
</li>
<li>
	the execution of <code>x = 1</code> ends before
	the execution of <code>y = 1</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func fab() {
	var a, b int
	var l sync.Mutex // or sync.RWMutex

	l.Lock()
	go func() {
		l.Lock()
		b = 1
		l.Unlock()
	}()
	go func() {
		a = 1
		l.Unlock()
	}()
}

func fmn() {
	var m, n int
	var l sync.RWMutex

	l.RLock()
	go func() {
		l.Lock()
		n = 1
		l.Unlock()
	}()
	go func() {
		m = 1
		l.RUnlock()
	}()
}

func fxy() {
	var x, y int
	var l sync.RWMutex

	l.Lock()
	go func() {
		l.RLock()
		y = 1
		l.RUnlock()
	}()
	go func() {
		x = 1
		l.Unlock()
	}()
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

Note, in the following code, by the official Go documentations,
the execution of <code>p = 1</code> is not guaranteed to end before the execution of <code>q = 1</code>,
though most compilers do make such guarantees.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">var p, q int
func fpq() {
	var l sync.Mutex
	p = 1
	l.Lock()
	l.Unlock()
	q = 1
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>


<h4>Order guarantees made by <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> values</h4>

<p>
At a given time, assume the counter maintained by
an addressable <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> value <code>wg</code> is not zero.
If there are a group of <code>wg.Add(n)</code> method calls invoked after the given time,
and we can make sure that only the last returned call among the group of calls
will modify the counter maintained by <code>wg</code> to zero,
then each of the group of calls is guaranteed to happen before the return
of a <code>wg.Wait</code> method call which is invoked after the given time.
</p>

<p>
Note, <code>wg.Done()</code> is equivalent to <code>wg.Add(-1)</code>.
</p>

<p>
Please read <a href="concurrent-synchronization-more.html#waitgroup">the explanations
for the <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> type</a> to get how to use <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> values.
</p>

<h4>Order guarantees made by <code>sync.Once</code> values</h4>

<p>
Please read <a href="concurrent-synchronization-more.html#once">the explanations
for the <code>sync.Once</code> type</a> to get the order guarantees
made by <code>sync.Once</code> values and how to use <code>sync.Once</code> values.
</p>

<h4>Order guarantees made by <code>sync.Cond</code> values</h4>

<p>
It is some hard to make a clear description for
the order guarantees made by <code>sync.Cond</code> values.
Please read <a href="concurrent-synchronization-more.html#cond">the explanations
for the <code>sync.Cond</code> type</a> to get how to use <code>sync.Cond</code> values.
</p>

<a class="anchor" id="atomic"></a>
<h4>Atomic operations related order guarantees</h4>

<div>
<p>
None of Go's official documentation mentions what memory order guarantees
are made by the atomic synchronization technique.
However, in the implementation of the standard Go compiler,
there are exactly some memory order guarantees made by atomic operations.
The standard packages rely extensively on the guarantees provided by atomic operations.
</p>

The following program always prints <code>1</code>,
if it is compiled with the standard Go compiler 1.12.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"
import "sync/atomic"
import "runtime"

func main() {
	var a, b int32 = 0, 0

	go func() {
		atomic.StoreInt32(&a, 1)
		atomic.StoreInt32(&b, 1)
	}()

	for {
		if n := atomic.LoadInt32(&b); n == 1 {
			// The following line always prints 1.
			fmt.Println(atomic.LoadInt32(&a))
			break
		}
		runtime.Gosched()
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Here, the main goroutine will always observe that the modification
of <code>a</code> ends before the modification of <code>b</code>.
However, the guarantees made by atomic operations are not
written down in the Go specification and any other official Go documentations.
If you want to write cross-compiler and cross-compiler-version compatible Go code,
the safe advice is,
<b>don't rely on atomic to guarantee memory orderings in general Go programming</b>.
There is <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/5045">an issue</a>
on how these guarantees should be written down.
But, up to now (Go 1.12), the decision has not been made yet.
</p>

<p>
Please read <a href="concurrent-atomic-operation.html">this article</a>
to get how to do atomic operations.

For the complexity and subtlety of properly using atomic functions, atomic functions are not recommended
to synchronize values. Mutexes are more preferred.
Some Go team members are regreted that the atomic package is expose as a public standard package
and think the atomic package should only be used inside standard pckages and runtime code.

We generally don’t want sync/atomic to be used at all
Experience has shown us again and again that
very very few people are capable of writing correct code
that uses atomic operations…If we had thought of internal packages
when we added the sync/atomic package, perhaps we would have used that.
Now we can’t remove the package because of the Go 1 guarantee.
