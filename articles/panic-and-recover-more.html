<h1>The Right Places to Call the <code>recover</code> Function</h1>

<p>
Panic and recover mechanism has been
<a href="control-flows-more.html#panic-recover">introduced before</a>,
and several panic/recover use cases are shown in
<a href="panic-and-recover-use-cases.html">the last article</a>.
We know that a <code>recover</code> call can only take effect
if it is invoked in a deferred function call.
However, not all <code>recover</code> calls in deferred function calls
can catch alive panics.
The remaining of this article will show some useless <code>recover</code> function calls
and explain what are the right places to call the <code>recover</code> function.
</p>

<div>
Let's view an example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	defer func() {
		defer func() {
			fmt.Println("7:", recover())
		}()
	}()
	defer func() {
		func() {
			fmt.Println("6:", recover())
		}()
	}()
	func() {
		defer func() {
			fmt.Println("1:", recover())
		}()
	}()
	func() {
		defer fmt.Println("2:", recover())
	}()
	func() {
		fmt.Println("3:", recover())
	}()
	fmt.Println("4:", recover())
	defer fmt.Println("5:", recover())
	panic(789)
	defer func() {
		fmt.Println("0:", recover())
	}()
}
</code></pre>

Run it, we will find that
none of the 8 <code>recover</code> calls in above program recover the program.
The program crashes with printing out the following panic stack traces.
<pre class="output"><code>1: &lt;nil&gt;
2: &lt;nil&gt;
3: &lt;nil&gt;
4: &lt;nil&gt;
5: &lt;nil&gt;
6: &lt;nil&gt;
7: &lt;nil&gt;
panic: 789

goroutine 1 [running]:
...
</code></pre>

Obviously, the 0th <code>recover</code> call (the last one) is not reachable.
For others, let's check the rules specified
in <a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Handling_panics">Go specification</a> firstly.

<div class="alert alert-success">
The return value of <code>recover</code> is <code>nil</code> if any of the following conditions holds:
<ul>
<li>panic's argument was nil;</li>
<li>the goroutine is not panicking;</li>
<li>recover was not called directly by a deferred function.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Let's ignore the first condition.
The second condition covers the 1st/2nd/3rd and 4th recover calls.
The third one covers the 5th and 6th recover calls.
However, none of the three conditions cover the 7th recover call.
</p>

We know the following <code>recover</code> call will catch the panic.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// example2.go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	defer func() {
		fmt.Println( recover() ) // 1
	}()

	panic(1)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
But, what is differences between it and the above <code>recover</code> calls?
What is the principle rule to make a <code>recover</code> call take effect?
</p>

<p>
Firstly, let's learn some concepts and facts.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Concept: Function Call Depth, Goroutine Execution Depth &amp; Panic Depth</h3>

<div>
<p>
Each function call associated to a call depth, which is related
the entry function call of the current goroutine.
For the main goroutine, the call depth of a function call
is related to the program <b><i>main</i></b> entry function call.
For a goroutine other than the main goroutine, the call depth of
a function call is related to the starting function call of the goroutine.
</p>

For example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() { // depth 0
	go func() { // depth 0
		func() { // depth 1
		}()

		defer func() { // depth 1
			defer func() { // depth 2
			}()
		}()
	}()

	func () { // depth 1
		func() { // depth 2
			go func() { // depth 0
			}()
		}()

		go func() { // depth 0
		}()
	}()
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
The depth of the call to the function containing the current execution point
of a goroutine is called the execution depth of the goroutine.
</p>

<p>
The depth of a panic is the function call depth the panic has propagated to.
Please read the next section for a better understanding.
</p>

<h3>Fact: Panics Can Only Propagate to the Function Calls With Shallower Depths</h3>

<div>
Yes, panics can only propagate to its callers.
Panics never propagate downwards into a deeper function call.

<pre class="line-numbers must-line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

var o = fmt.Println

func main() { // call depth 0
	defer func() { // call depth 1
		o("Now, the panic is still in call depth 0")
		func() { // call depth 2
			o("Now, the panic is still in call depth 0")
			func() { // call depth 3
				o("Now, the panic is still in call depth 0")
			}()
		}()
	}()

	defer o("Now, the panic is in call depth 0")

	func() { // call depth 1
		defer o("Now, the panic is in call depth 1")
		func() { // call depth 2
			defer o("Now, the panic is in call depth 2")
			func() { // call depth 3
				defer o("Now, the panic is in call depth 3")
				panic(1)
			}()
		}()
	}()
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>
</div>

<p>
So the depth of a panic is monotonically decreasing, it never increases.
And, the depth of an alive panic will never
be larger than the execution depth of the goroutine.
</p>

<h3>Fact: New Created Panics Will Suppress Old Panics at the Same Depth</h3>

<div>
Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	defer fmt.Println("program will not crash")

	defer func() {
		fmt.Println( recover() ) // 3
	}()

	defer fmt.Println("now, panic 3 suppresses panic 2")
	defer panic(3)
	defer fmt.Println("now, panic 2 suppresses panic 1")
	defer panic(2)
	panic(1)
}
</code></pre>

Outputs:
<pre class="output"><code>now, panic 2 suppresses panic 1
now, panic 3 suppresses panic 2
3
program will not crash
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
In this example, panic 1 is suppressed by panic 2,
and then panic 2 is suppressed by panic 3.
So, in the end, there is only one active panic, which is panic 3.
Panic 3 is recovered, hence the program will not crash.
</p>

<p>
In one goroutine, there will be at most one active panic at the same time at the same call depth.
In particular, when the execution point runs at the call depth 0 of a goroutine,
there will be at most one active panic in the goroutine.
</p>

<h3>Fact: Multiple Active Panics May Coexist in a Goroutine</h3>

<div>
Example:
<pre class="line-numbers must-line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() { // call depth 0
	defer fmt.Println("to crash, for panic 3 is still active")

	defer func() { // call depth 1
		defer func() { // call depth 2
			fmt.Println( recover() ) // 6
		}()

		// The depth of panic 3 is 0,
		// and the depth of panic 6 is 1.
		defer fmt.Println("now, two active panics: 3 and 6")
		defer panic(6) // will suppress panic 5
		defer panic(5) // will suppress panic 4

		// The following panic will not suppress
		// panic 3,  for they have different depths.
		// The depth of panic 3 is 0.
		// The depth of panic 4 is 1.
		panic(4)
	}()

	defer fmt.Println("now, only panic 3 is active")
	defer panic(3) // will suppress panic 2
	defer panic(2) // will suppress panic 1
	panic(1)
}
</code></pre>

<p>

In this example, panic 6, one of the two active panics, is recovered.
But the other active panic, panic 3, is still active at the end of main call,
so the program will crash.
</p>

The output:
<pre class="output"><code>now, only panic 3 is active
now, there are two active panics: 3 and 6
6
program will crash, for panic 3 is still active
panic: 1
	panic: 2
	panic: 3

goroutine 1 [running]
...
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Fact: Deeper Panics May Be Recovered at First or Not</h3>

<div>
Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func demo(recoverHighestPanicAtFirst bool) {
	fmt.Println("====================")
	defer func() {
		if !recoverHighestPanicAtFirst{
			// recover panic 1
			defer fmt.Println("panic", recover(), "is recovered")
		}
		defer func() {
			// recover panic 2
			fmt.Println("panic", recover(), "is recovered")
		}()
		if recoverHighestPanicAtFirst {
			// recover panic 1
			defer fmt.Println("panic", recover(), "is recovered")
		}
		defer fmt.Println("now, two active panics coexist")
		panic(2)
	}()
	panic(1)
}

func main() {
	demo(true)
	demo(false)
}
</code></pre>

The output:
<pre class="output"><code>====================
now, two active panics coexist
panic 1 is recovered
panic 2 is recovered
====================
now, two active panics coexist
panic 2 is recovered
panic 1 is recovered
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Then, What Is the Principle Rule to Make a <code>recover</code> Call Take Effect?</h3>

<div>
The rule is simple.

<div class="alert alert-info">
In a goroutine,
assume the caller function of a <code>recover</code> call is <code>f</code>
and the depth of the <code>f</code> call is <code>d</code>,
then, to make the <code>recover</code> call take effect,
the <code>f</code> call must be a deferred call and
there must be an active panic at depth <code>d-1</code>.
Whether or not the <code>recover</code> call itself is deferred is not important.
</div>

<p>
That is it. I think It is better described than Go specification.
Now you can page up to check why the 7th <code>recover</code> call in the first example
doesn't take effect, and some others do in some other examples.
</p>
</div>
