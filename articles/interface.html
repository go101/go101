<p>
Interface types are one special kind of types in Go.
Interface kind plays several important roles in Go.
Firstly, interface types make Go support value boxing.
Consequently, through value boxing, reflection and polymorphism get supported.
</p>

<p>
The remaining of this article will explain the functionalities of interfaces
in detail. Some interface related details will also be shown.
</p>

<h3>What Are Interface Types?</h3>

<p>
An interface type specifies a collection of
<a href=method.html#method-set">method prototypes</a>.
In other words, each interface type defines a method set.
In fact, we can view an interface type as a method set.
For any of the method prototype specified in an interface type,
its name can't be the blank identifier <code>_</code>.
</p>

<div>
Some examples of interface types:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// This is an unnamed interface type.
interface {
	About() string
}

// ReadWriter is a defined interface type.
type ReadWriter interface {
	Read(buf []byte) (n int, err error)
	Write(buf []byte) (n int, err error)
}

// Comparable is also a named interface alias type.
type Comparable = interface {
	IsEqualTo(another Comparable) bool
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

Please note that the <code>error</code> result type in the method prototypes
specified by the <code>ReadWriter</code> interface type is
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/#error">a built-in interface type</a>.
It is defined as

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type error interface {
        Error() string
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

In particular, an interface type with a blank method prototype collection
is called a blank interface type. Some blank interface types examples:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">// An unnamed blank interface type.
interface{}

// Type I is a defined blank interface type.
type I interface{}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>The Method Set Of A Type</h3>

<div>
Each type has a <a href=method.html#method-set">method set</a> associated with it.
<ul>
<li>
	For an interface type, its method set is the method prototype collection it specifies.
</li>
<li>
	For a non-interface type, its method set is the prototype collection of
	all the methods declared, either explicitly or implicitly, for the non-interface type.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><i>
(About methods of non-interface types, please read
<a href="method.html">methods in Go</a> and
<a href="type-embedding.html">type embedding</a>.)
</i></p>

<p>
For convenience, the method set of a type is often also called
the method set of any value of the type.
</p>

<p>
Two unnamed interface types are identical if their method set are identical.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="implementation"></p>
<h3>What Are Implementations?</h3>

<p>
If the method set of an arbrtrary type <code>T</code>, <code>T</code>
may be an interface type or not,
is a super set of the method set of an interface type <code>I</code>,
then we say type <code>T</code> implements interface <code>I</code>.
</p>

<p>
Implementations are all implicit in Go.
The implementation relations are not needed to be specified for compiler in code explicitly.
There is not a <code>implements</code> keyword in Go.
Go compiler will check the implementation relations automaticlly as needed.
</p>

<p>
An interface type always implements itself.
Two interface types with the same method set implement each other.
</p>

<div>
For example, in the following example, the method sets of
stuct pointer type <code>*Book</code>, integer type <code>MyInt</code> and
pointer type <code>*MyInt</code> are both contains the method prototype
<code>About() string</code>, so they both implement the above mentioned
interface type <code>interface {About() string}</code>.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type Book struct {
	name string
	// more other fileds ...
}

func (book *Book) About() string {
	return "Book: " + book.name
}

type MyInt int

func (MyInt) About() string {
	return "I'm a custom integer value"
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
Note, as any method set is a super set of a blank method set,
so <b>any type implements any blank interface type</b>.
This is an important fact in Go.
</p>


The implicit implementation design makes it possible to let concrete types defined
in other library packages, such as standard packages,
passively implement some interface types declared in user packages.
For example, if we define an interface type as the following one,
then the type <code>DB</code> and <code>Tx</code> types in the <code>database/sql</code>
standard package will both implement the interface type automatically,
for they both have the three corresponding methods specified in the interface.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type DatabaseStorer interface {
	Exec(query string, args ...interface{}) (Result, error)
	Prepare(query string) (*Stmt, error)
	Query(query string, args ...interface{}) (*Rows, error)
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="boxing"></p>
<h3>Value Boxing</h3>

<div>
<p>
In Go, if a type <code>T</code> implements an interface type <code>I</code>,
then any value of type <code>T</code> can be implicitly converted to type <code>I</code>.
In other words, any value of type <code>T</code> is
<a href="constants-and-variables.html#assignment">assignable</a>
to (addressable) values of type <code>I</code>.
</p>

In such a conversion (or an assignment),
<ul>
<li>
	If type <code>T</code> is a non-interface type, then
	the a copy of the <code>T</code> value is boxed (or encapsulated)
	into the result (or destination) <code>I</code> value.
	The time complexity of the copy is <code><i>O</i>(n)</code>,
	where <code>n</code> is the size of copied <code>T</code> value.
</li>
<li>
	If type <code>T</code> is also an interface type, then
	a copy of the value boxed in the <code>T</code> value is boxed
	(or encapsulated) into the result (or destination) <code>I</code> value.
	The standard Go compiler makes an optimazation here,
	so the time complexity of the copy is <code><i>O</i>(1)</code>,
	instead of <code><i>O</i>(n)</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The type infomation of the boxed value is also stored in the result interface value.
</p>

<p>
When a value is boxed in an interface value, the value is called
the <b><i>dynamic value</i></b> of the interface value.
The type of the dynamic value is called the
<b><i>dynamic type</i></b> of the interface value.
</p>

<p>
The dynamic value of an interface value must be a non-interface value.
The dynamic value itself is immutable.
</p>

<p>
Dynamic values and dynamic types are also called
concrete values and concrete types sometimes.
</p>

<p>
In Go, the zero values of any interface type are represented by the predeclared <code>nil</code>.
Nothing is boxed in a nil interface value.
Assign an untyped <code>nil</code> to an interface value will
clear the dynamic value boxed in the interface value.
</p>

<p><i>
(Note, the zero values of many non-interface types in Go
are also represented by <code>nil</code> in Go.
Non-interface nil values can also be boxed in interface values.
Such interface values are not nil interface values.)
</i></p>

<p>
As any type implements any blank interface types,
so any non-interface value can be boxed in (or assigned to) a blank interface value.
For this reason, blank interface types can be viewed as the
<code>any</code> or <code>Any</code> type in many other languages.
When an untyped value (except untype <code>nil</code> values)
is assigned to a blank interface value,
the untyped value will be first converted to its default type.
(Or, we can think the untyped value is deduced as a value of its default type.)
</p>

Let's view an exmaple which demonstrates some assignments
with interface values as destination values.


<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type Aboutable interface {
	About() string
}

// Type *Book implements Aboutable
type Book struct {
	name string
}
func (book *Book) About() string {
	return "Book: " + book.name
}

func main() {
	// A *Book value is boxed into an Aboutable value.
	var a Aboutable = &Book{"Go 101"}
	fmt.Println(a) // &{Go 101}
	
	// i is a blank interface value.
	var i interface{} = &Book{"Rust 101"}
	fmt.Println(i) // &{Rust 101}

	// Aboutable implements interface{}.
	i = a
	fmt.Println(i) // &{Go 101}
}
</code></pre>

Please note, the prototype of the <code>fmt.Println</code> function is

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func Println(a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
</code></pre>

<p>
This is why a <code>fmt.Println</code> function call can take arguments of
any type.
</p>

The following is another example which shows how a blank interface value
is used to box values of any non-interface type.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i interface{}
	i = []int{1, 2, 3}
	fmt.Println(i) // [1 2 3]
	i = map[string]int{"Go": 2012}
	fmt.Println(i) // map[Go:2012]
	i = true
	fmt.Println(i) // true
	i = 1
	fmt.Println(i) // 1
	i = "abc"
	fmt.Println(i) // abc

	// Clear the boxed value in interface value i.
	i = nil
	fmt.Println(i) // <nil>
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

As above has mentioned, the information of the dynamic type if an interface
value is also stored in (more accureately, referenced by) the interface value.
The dynamic type information is essential 
for implementing two important features in Go.
<ol>
<li>
	The dynamic type information includes a method table which stores
	all the corresponding methods specified by the interface type
	and declared for the dynamic type of the interface type.
	This table is the key of implementing <a href="#polymorphism">polymorphism</a> in Go.
</li>
<li>
	The dynamic type information also includes all sorts of
	other information about the dynamic type, such as
	what <a href="type-system-overview.html#type-kinds">kind</a> the dynamic type belongs to
	and the method and field lists of the dynamic type, etc.
	The information is the key of implementing <a href="#reflection">reflection</a> in Go.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
At run time, the information items of all types are stored in a global zone.
Each interface value just holds a reference to one type information item.
Each non-interface to interface type implementation relation corresponds
to one global method table.
For the standard Go cimpler/runtime.
a method table will only be created as needed.
</p>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="polymorphism"></p>
<h3>Polymorphism</h3>

<p>
Polymorphism is one key functionality provided by interfaces,
and it is an important feature of Go.
</p>

<p>
When a non-interface value <code>t</code> of a type <code>T</code>
is boxed in an interface value <code>i</code> of type <code>I</code>,
call a method declared by the interface type <code>I</code>
on the interface value <code>i</code>
will call the corresponding method defined for the non-interface type <code>T</code>
on the non-interface value <code>t</code> acctually.
In other words, call method <code>i.m</code> will call method <code>t.m</code> acctually.
With different values boxed into the interface value,
the interface value behaves differently.
This is called polymorphism.
</p>

<p>
The method table stored in an interface value is a slice.
Mehtod lookup in the table is just a slice element indexing.
</p>

<p><i>
(Note, call methods on a nil interface value will panic at run time,
for there are no available declared methods can be called.)
</i></p>

<div>
An example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type Filter interface {
	About() string
	Process([]int) []int
}

// A UniqueFilter will remove duplicated numbers.
type UniqueFilter struct{}
func (UniqueFilter) About() string {
	return "remove diplicated numbers"
}
func (UniqueFilter) Process(inputs []int) []int {
	var outs = make([]int, 0, len(inputs))
	var pusheds = make(map[int]bool)
	for _, n := range inputs {
		if !pusheds[n] {
			pusheds[n] = true
			outs = append(outs, n)
		}
	}
	return outs
}

// A MultipleFilter will only keep numbers which are
// multiples of the MultipleFilter as an integer.
type MultipleFilter int
func (mf MultipleFilter) About() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("keep multiples of %v", mf)
}
func (mf MultipleFilter) Process(inputs []int) []int {
	var outs = make([]int, 0, len(inputs))
	for _, n := range inputs {
		if n % int(mf) == 0 {
			outs = append(outs, n)
		}
	}
	return outs
}

// With the help of polymorphism, only one "filteAndPrint"
// function is needed.
func filteAndPrint(fltr Filter, unfiltered []int) []int {
	// Call the methods of "fltr" will call the methods
	// of the value boxed in "fltr" acctually.
	filtered := fltr.Process(unfiltered)
	fmt.Println(fltr.About() + ":\n\t", filtered)
	return filtered
}

func main() {
	numbers := []int{12, 7, 21, 12, 12, 26, 25, 21, 30}
	fmt.Println("before filtering:\n\t", numbers)
	
	// Three non-interface values are boxed into three Filter
	// interface slice element values.
	filters := []Filter{
		UniqueFilter{},
		MultipleFilter(2),
		MultipleFilter(3),
	}

	// Each slice element will be assigned to the local variable
	// "fltr" (of interface type Filter) one by one. The value
	// boxed in each element will also be copied to "fltr".
	for _, fltr := range filters {
		numbers = filteAndPrint(fltr, numbers)
	}
}
</code></pre>

The output:
<pre class="output"><code>before filtering:
	 [12 7 21 12 12 26 25 21 30]
remove diplicated numbers:
	 [12 7 21 26 25 30]
keep multiples of 2:
	 [12 26 30]
keep multiples of 3:
	 [12 30]
</code></pre>

<p>
In the above example, polymorphism makes it is unnecessary to
write one <code>filteAndPrint</code> function for each filter types.
</p>

<p>
Besides the above benifit, polymorphism also makes it possible for
package developers to write exported functions and methods which
accept any user defined types, as long as the user types implement the
interface types of the parameters of the exported functions and methods.
</p>
</div>

<p>
In fact, polymorphism is not an essential feature.
There are alternative ways to achieve the same job,
such as callback functions.
But the polymorphism way is cleaner and more elegent.
</p>

<p class="anchor" id="reflection"></p>
<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p>
The dynamic type information storages in an interface value
can be used to inspect and manipulate the dynamic value which is boxed in the interface value.
This is called reflection in programming.
The method sets declared by interface types and
the method table stored in interface values are not used in reflection.
</p>

<p>
Currently (v1.10), Go doesn't support generic for custom functions and types.
Reflection partially remedies the inconveniences caused by lacking of generic.
</p>

<p>
This article will not explain the functionalities provided by
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/">the <code>reflect</code> standard package</a>.
Please read <a href="reflection.html">Reflections In Go</a> to get how to use this package.
Below will only introduce the built-in reflection functionalities in Go.
In Go, built-in reflections are achieved with type assertion and type switch.
</p>

<h4>Type Assertion</h4>

<div>
There are four kinds of interface value involved value conversions in Go:
<ol>
<li>
	convert non-interface value to interface value, where the type of the non-interface value
	must implement the type of the interface value.
</li>
<li>
	convert interface value to interface value, where the type of the source interface value
	must implement the type of the destination interface value.
</li>
<li>
	convert interface value to non-interface value, where the type of the non-interface value
	may or may not implement the type of the interface value.
</li>
<li>
	convert interface value to interface value, where the type of the destination interface value
	may or may not implement the type of the source interface value.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Above has explained the first two.
The two both require the source value type must implement the destination interface type.
The convertibility for the first two are verified at compile time.
</p>

<p>
Here will explain the later two.
The convertibility for the later two are verified and acieved at run time,
by using a syntax called <b><i>type assertion</i></b>.
In fact, the syntax also applies to the second kind of conversions.
</p>

The form of type assertion expression is <code>i.(T)</code>,
where <code>i</code> is an interface value and <code>T</code> is
<ul>
<li>
	either a non-interface type which must implement the type of <code>i</code>
</li>
<li>
	or an arbrtrary interface type.
</li>
</ul>

In a type assertion <code>i.(T)</code>,
<code>i</code> is called the asserted value
and <code>T</code> is called the asserted type.
A type assertion would succeed or fail.
<ul>
<li>
	If <code>T</code> is a non-interface type,
	then the intention of the type assertions is
	to get the dynamic values boxed in an interface value.
	<code>T</code> must be the dynamic type of <code>i</code>
	to make the assertion succeed.
	Each of such cases can be viewed as a value unboxing attempt.
</li>
<li>
	If <code>T</code> is an interface type,
	then the intention of the type assertion is to make the dynamic value
	boxed in an interface value also boxed in another interface value of
	type <code>T</code>.
	The dynamic value of <code>i</code> must be convertible to
	interface type <code>T</code> to make the assertion succeed.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
For most scenarios, a type assertion results one value of the asserted type
and is viewed as a single-valued expression.
However, when a type assertion is used as the only source value expression
in an assignment, it can be viewed as a multi-valued expression
and result a second optional untyped boolean value,
which indicates whether or not the type assersion succeeds.
</p>

<p>
If a type assersion fails, the first return result must be
a zero value of the asserted type, and the second return result
(assume it is present) is an untyped boolean value <code>false</code>.
If it succeeds, then the first return result is a copy of
the dynamic value of the asserted interface value, and the second return result
(assume it is present) is an untyped boolean value <code>true</code>.
</p>

<p>
If a type assersion fails and the type assertion is used as a
single-valued expression (the second return result is absent),
a panic will occur.
</p>

An example (<code>T</code> is a non-interface type):
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Compiler will deduce the type of 123 as int.
	var x interface{} = 123
	
	// Case 1:
	n, ok := x.(int)
	fmt.Println(n, ok) // 123 true
	n = x.(int)
	fmt.Println(n) // 123
	
	// Case 2:
	a, ok := x.(float64)
	fmt.Println(a, ok) // 0 false
	
	// Case 3:
	a = x.(float64) // Will panic.
}
</code></pre>

Another example (<code>T</code> is an interface type):
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type Writer interface {
	Write(buf []byte) (int, error)
}

type DummyWriter struct{}
func (DummyWriter) Write(buf []byte) (int, error) {
	return len(buf), nil
}

func main() {
	var x interface{} = DummyWriter{}
	var y interface{} = "abc" // dynamic type is string.
	var w Writer
	var ok bool
	
	// DummyWriter implements both Writer and interface{}.
	w, ok = x.(Writer)
	fmt.Println(w, ok) // {} true
	x, ok = w.(interface{})
	fmt.Println(x, ok) // {} true
	
	// The dynamic type of y is string, which doesn't
	// implement Writer.
	w, ok = y.(Writer)
	fmt.Println(w, ok) // &ltnil&gt; false
	w = y.(Writer) // Will panic.
}
</code></pre>

<p>
In fact, the method call of <code>i.m(...)</code> on an interface value <code>i</code>
which dynamic type is <code>T</code> is equivalent to the method call of <code>i.(T).m(...)</code>.
</p>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="type-switch"></p>
<h4>Type Switch Control Flow Block</h4>

<div>

The type swtich syntax may be the weirdest syntax in Go.
It can be viewed as the enhanced version of type assertion.
A type switch block looks like:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">switch v := x.(type) {
case TypeA:
	...
case TypeB, TypeC:
	...
case nil:
	...
default:
	...
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The <code>case</code> keywords in a type swtich block can be followed by
a <code>nil</code> identifier, one or more type names and type literals.
None of such items can follow more than one <code>case</code> keywords
at the same time in the same type swtich block.
</p>

<p>
If the type denoted by a type name or type literal following a <code>case</code> keyword
in a type swtich block is not an interface type, then it
must implement the interface type of the interface value followed by <code>.(type)</code>.
</p>

Here is an example of type switch:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	values := []interface{}{
		456, "abc", true, 0.33, int32(789),
		[]int{1, 2, 3}, map[int]bool{}, nil,
	}
	for _, x := range values {
		// Here, v is declared once, but it denotes
		// different varialbes in different branches.
		switch v := x.(type) {
		case []int: // type literal
			// The type of v is []int.
			fmt.Println("int slice:", v)
		case string: // one type name
			// The type of v is string.
			fmt.Println("string:", v)
		case int, float64, int32: // multiple type names
			// The type of v is always same as x.
			// In this example, it is interface{}.
			fmt.Println("number:", v)
		case nil:
			// The type of v is always same as x.
			// In this example, it is interface{}.
			fmt.Println(v)
		default:
			// The type of v is always same as x.
			// In this example, it is interface{}.
			fmt.Println("others:", v)
		}
		// Note, each variable denoted by v in the
		// last three branches is a copy of x.
	}
}
</code></pre>

The output:
<pre class="output"><code>number: 456
string: abc
others: true
number: 0.33
number: 789
int slice: [1 2 3]
others: map[]
&lt;nil&gt;
</code></pre>

The above example is equalenvent to the following one:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	values := []interface{}{
		456, "abc", true, 0.33, int32(789),
		[]int{1, 2, 3}, map[int]bool{}, nil,
	}
	for _, x := range values {
		if v, ok := x.([]int); ok {
			fmt.Println("int slice:", v)
		} else if v, ok := x.(string); ok {
			fmt.Println("string:", v)
		} else if x == nil {
			v := x
			fmt.Println(v)
		} else {
			_, isInt := x.(int)
			_, isFloat64 := x.(float64)
			_, isInt32 := x.(int32)
			if isInt || isFloat64 || isInt32 {
				v := x
				fmt.Println("number:", v)
			} else {
				v := x
				fmt.Println("others:", v)
			}
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>

Some details about type switch:
<ul>
<li>
	unlike general switch blocks, <code>fallthrough</code> statement can't be used within
	branch blocks of a type swtich block.
</li>
<li>
	like general switch blocks, if the <code>default</code> branch is present,
	it can be the last branch, the first branch, or a middle branch.
</li>
<li>
	like general switch blocks,
	between the <code>switch</code> keyword and the assertion,
	a simple statement is allowed to be present.
	For example, <code>switch x := f(); v := x.(type) {...}</code>.
</li>

<h3>More About Interfaces In Go</h3>

<p class="anchor" id="embedding"></p>
<h4>Interface Type Embedding</h4>

<div>
In Go, an interface type can embed another named interface type.
The final effect is the same as unfolding the method prototypes
specified by the embedded interface type into the definition body
of the embedding interface type.
For example, given the following two named interface types:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type Ia interface {
	fa()
}

type Ib interface {
	fb()
}
</code></pre>

then the following interface type:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">interface {
	Ia
	Ib
}
</code></pre>

has the identical method set as <code>Ic</code>:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">type Ic interface {
	fa()
	fb()
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

Up to now (Go 1.10), if two interface types both have a method declaration with the same name,
then they can't be embedded as the same time in other interface types,
even if the two same name methods have the same prototype.
For example, the following two interafce types are both illegal:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">interface {
	Ia
	Ic
}

interface {
	Ib
	Ic
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="comparison"></p>
<h4>Interface Values Involved Comparisons</h4>

<div>
There are two cases of interface values involved comparisons:
<ol>
<li>
	comparisons between a non-interface value and an interface value.
</li>
<li>
	comparisons between two interface values.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For the first case,
the type of the non-interface value must implement the type of the interface value,
so the non-interface value can be converted to (boxed into) an interface value.
This means a comparison between a non-interface value and an interface value
can be translated to a comparison between two interface values.
So below only comparisons between two interface values will be explained.
</p>

The steps of comparing two interface values (with the <code>==</code> operator).
<ol>
<li>
	If one of two interface values is a nil interface value,
	then the comparison result is whether or not the other intrface value is also a nil interface value.
</li>
<li>
	If the dynamic types of the two interface values are two different types,
	then the comparison result is false.
</li>
<li>
	For the case of the dynamic types of the two interface values are the same type,
	<ul>
	<li>
		if the same dynamic type is an
		<a href="value-conversions-assignments-and-comparisons.html#comparison-rules">uncomparable type</a>,
		then panic.
	</li>
	<li>
		otherwise, the comparing result is the result of comparing the dynamic values of the two interface values.
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ol>

An example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a, b, c interface{} = "abc", 123, "a"+"b"+"c"
	fmt.Println(a == b) // a case for step 3. Print "false".
	fmt.Println(a == c) // a case for step 3. Print "true".
	
	var s []int = nil // []int is not a comparable type
	var i interface{} = s

	fmt.Println(i == nil) // a case for step 1. Print "false".
	fmt.Println(i == i)   // a case for step 2. Will panic.
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>The Internal Structure Of Interface Values</h4>

<p>
For the offcial Go compiler/runtime, blank interface values and non-blank interface values
are represented with two different internal structures.
Please read <a href="value-part.html#interface-structure">value parts</a> for details.
</p>

<h4>Pointer Dynamic Value vs. Non-Pointer Dynamic Value</h4>

<p>
The offcial Go compiler/runtime makes an optimization
which makes than boxing pointer values in interface values
is more efficient than boxing non-pointer values.
For <a href="value-copy-cost.html">small sized values</a>,
the efficiency difference is small,
but for large sized values, the difference may be not small.
For the same optimization, type assertions with a pointer type
are also more efficient than type assertions with the base type
of the pointer type if the base type is a large sized type.
</p>

<p>
So please try to avoid boxing large sized values, box their pointers instead.
</p>

<p><i>
(BTW, for the standard Go compiler and runtime,
types other than array and struct types are all small sized types.
Struct types with very few fields are also small sized.)
</i></p>

<h4>Values Of <code>[]T</code> Can't Be Directly Converted To <code>[]I</code>
	Even If Type <code>T</code> Implements Interface Type<code>I</code>.</h4>

<div>
For exampel, sometimes, we may need to concert a <code>[]string</code> value
to <code>[]interface</code> type. Unlike some other languages, there is no
direct ways to make the conversion. We must make the conversion manually in a loop:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

// The prototype of fmt.Println function is
// func Println(a ...interface{}) (n int, err error).
// So a []string argument can't be passed to it.

func main() {
	words := []string{
		"Go", "is", "a", "high",
		"efficient", "language.",
	}
	// fmt.Println(words...) // not compile

	// Convert []string value to []interface{}.
	var iw []interface{}
	for _, w := range words {
		iw = append(iw, w)
	}
	fmt.Println(iw...) // compiles okay
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4>Each Method Specified In An Interface Type Corresponds An Implicit Function</h4>

<div>

<p>
For each method with name <code>m</code>
in the method set defined by an interface type <code>I</code>,
compiler will implicitly declare a function named <code>I.m</code>,
which has one more input parameter, of type <code>I</code>, than method <code>m</code>.
The extra parameter is the first input parameter of function <code>I.m</code>.
A call to the function <code>I.m(i, ...)</code>
is equivalent to the method call <code>i.m(...)</code>.
</p>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

type I interface {
	m(int)bool
}

type T string
func (t T) m(n int) bool {
	return len(t) > n
}

func main() {
	var i I = T("gopher")
	fmt.Println (i.m(5))                         // true
	fmt.Println (I.m(i, 5))                      // true
	fmt.Println (interface {m(int)bool}.m(i, 5)) // true
	
	// The following lines compile okay, but will panic at run time.
	I(nil).m(5)
	I.m(nil, 5)
	interface {m(int)bool}.m(nil, 5)
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<!---



should try to avoid to box large-size values. assignments will copy the boxed values.

http://commaok.xyz/post/interface-allocs

since Go1.5, in the official compiler implementation (), if the dynamic value
is not a pointer, the runtime will alloc memory for a copy of the danymic value and
storage the pointers of the copy in the interface value.


need a special article: the underlying structures of blank interface and non-blank interface.
