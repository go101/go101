<h1>Structs In Go</h1>

<p>
Same as C, Go also supports struct types.
This article will introduce the basic kwowledges of struct types in Go.
</p>

<h3>Struct Types And Struct Type Literals</h3>

<div>
Each unnamed struct type literal starts with a <code>struct</code> keyword
which is following by a sequence of field definitions enclosed in a <code>{}</code>.
Each field definition is composed of a name and a type.
The number of fields of a struct type can be zero.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">struct {
	title  string
	author string
	pages  int
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The above strict has three fields. The types of the two fields
<code>title</code> and <code>author</code> are both <code>string</code>.
The type of the <code>pages</code> field is <code>int</code>.
</p>

<p>
Some articles also call fields as member variables.
</p>

Consecutive fields with the same type can be declared together.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">struct {
	title, author string
	pages         int
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The size of a struct type is the sum of the sizes of all its field types.
The size of a zero-field struct type is zero.
</p>

Each struct field can be bound with a tag when it is declared.
Field tags are optional, the default value of field tags are blank strings.
Here is an example showing non-default filed tags.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">struct {
	Title  string `json:"title"`
	Author string `json:"author,omitempty"`
	Pages  int    `json:"pages,omitempty"`
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The purpose of each field tag is application dependent.
In the above example, the filed tags can help the functions in the
<code>encoding/json</code> standard package to determine the field names in JSON texts,
in the process of encoding struct values into JSON texts or decoding JSON texts into struct values.
The functions in the <code>encoding/json</code> standard package will
only encode and decode the exported struct fields, which is why
the first letters of the field names in the above example are all upper cased.
If the field tags are not specified, then the corresponding field names in JSON texts
will be same as the field names in code.
</p>

<p><i>
(BTW, the <code>omitempty</code> word in a field tag means the field can be absent
from the JSON texts if the value of the field is a zero value or a blank container value.)
</i></p>

<p>
It is not good idea to use field tags as comments.
</p>

<p>
Raw string literals (<code>`...`</code>) are used more popular than
interpreted string literals (<code>"..."</code>) for field tags in practice.
</p>

<p>
Unlike C language, Go structs don't support union.
</p>

<p>
Only exported fields of exported struct types declared in a package
can be used in other packages by importing the pacakge.
</p>

<p>
Please note, non-exported field names of struct types from
different packages are always viewed as different names.
</p>

The field tags and the orders of the field declaraions matter for a struct type.
Two non-defined struct types are identical if they have the same sequence of fields, 
and if corresponding fields have the same names, and identical types, and identical tags. 
In other words, two non-defined struct types are two distinct types even if they have
the same set of field declarations but if any of the following ones is true:
<ul>
<li>
	the field declaration orders are different.
</li>
<li>
	at least one pair of the corresponding field tags are different.
</li>
<li>
	the two struct types are from two different package and at least
	one name of their fields is non-exported.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All above shown struct types are unnamed, or called anonymous struct types.
In practice, named (defined or alias) struct types are used more popular.
</p>

<!---
A struct type can't have a field of the struct type itself,
either directly or recursively.

<h3>Struct Value Literals And Struct Value Manipulations</h3>

<p>
In Go, the form <code>T{...}</code>,
where <code>T</code> must be a type literal or a type name,
is called as a <b>composite literal</b> and
is used as the value literals of some kinds of types,
including struct types and the container types introduced later.
</p>

<div>
Given a struct type <code>S</code> and assume it has two fields,
<code>x int</code> and <code>y bool</code> in order,
then the zero value of <code>S</code> can be represented by the following
two variants of struct composite literal forms:
<ol>
<li>
	<code>S{0, false}</code>.
	In this form, none field names are present but all filed values must be present
	by the field declaration orders.
</li>
<li>
	<code>S{x: 0, y: false}</code>, <code>S{y: false, x: 0}</code>,
	<code>S{x: 0}</code>, <code>S{y: false}</code> and <code>S{}</code>.
	In this form, each field is optional to be present.
	The values of the absent fields will be set as the zero values of their corresponding types.
	But if a field is present, it must be with the <code>FieldName: FieldValue</code> form.
	The order of the fields in this form doesn't matter.
	The form <code>S{}</code> is used most often in practice.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
If <code>S</code> is a struct type imported from other packages,
it is recommended to use the second form.
</p>

<p>
For a value <code>v</code> of type <code>S</code>, we can use
<code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code>, which are called selectors,
to access the field values of <code>v</code>.
</p>

An example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Book struct {
	title, author string
	pages         int
}

func main() {
	book := Book{"Go 101", "Tapir", 256}
	fmt.Println(book.pages) // 256
	
	// Create a book value with another form.
	book = Book{} // title and author are both "", pages is 0
	book = Book{author: "Tapir"} // title is "" and pages is 0
	book = Book{author: "Tapir", pages: 256, title: "Go 101"}

	// Initialize a struct value without
	// using composite literals.
	var book2 Book // <=> book2 := Book{}
	book2.title = "Go 202"
}
</code></pre>

<p></p>

The last <code>,</code> in a compoiste literal is optional
if the last item in the literal and the closing <code>}</code>
are at the same line.
Otherwise, the last <code>,</code> is required.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">var _ = Book {
	author: "Go 101",
	pages: 256,
	title: "Go 101", // here, the "," can't be ommitted.
}

// The last "," in the following line can be ommitted.
var _ = Book{author: "Go 101", pages: 256, title: "Go 101",} 
</code></pre>

</div>

<h3>About Struct Value Assignments</h3>

<div>
When a struct value is assigned to another sturct value,
the effect is the same as assigning each field one by one.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func f() {
	book1 := Book{pages: 300}
	book2 := Book{"Go 101", "Tapir", 256}
	
	book2 = book1
	// The above line is equivalent to the following three lines.
	book2.title = book1.title
	book2.author = book1.author
	book2.pages = book1.pages
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Two struct values can be assigned to each other only if
the types of the two struct values have the identical underlying type (considering field tags)
and at least one of the struct types is an
<a href="type-system-overview.html#non-defined-type">non-defined type</a>.
</p>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="field-addressability"></p>
<h3>Struct Field Addressability</h3>

<div>
<p>
The fields of an addressable struct value are also addressable.
The fields of an unaddressable struct value are also unaddressable.
The fields of unaddressable struct values can't be modified.
All composite Literals, including struct composite literal are unaddressable.
<p>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	type Book struct {
		Pages int
	}
	var book = Book{} // book is addressable
	p := &book.Pages  // take the address of the "Pages" field
	*p = 123
	fmt.Println(book) // {123}
	
	/*
	Book{}.Pages = 123 // This line doesn't compile,
	                   // for "Book{}" is unaddressable.
	*/
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="take-composite-literal-address"></p>
<h3>Composite Literals Are Unaddressable But Can Be Taken Addresses</h3>

<div>
Generally, only addressable values can be taken addresses.
But there is a syntax sugar in Go, which allows us to
take addesses on compisite literals.
A syntax sugar is an exception in syntax to make programming convinient.
For example,
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	type Book struct {
		Pages int
	}
	// Book{100} is unaddressable but can be taken address
	p := &Book{100}
	p.Pages = 200
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Use Struct Pointers Like Struct Values</h3>

<div>
<p>
Unlike C, in Go, there is not the <code>-&gt;</code> operator for accessing
struct fields through struct pointers.
In Go, the struct field acceessment operator for struct fields is also
the dot sign <code>.</code>.
</p>

For example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	type Book struct {
		pages int
	}
	book1 := &Book{100} // book1 is a poiner.
	book2 := new(Book)  // book2 is another pointer.
	book2.pages = book1.pages
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<p class="anchor" id="comparison"></p>
<h3>About Struct Value Comparisons</h3>

<p>
Most struct types are comparable types, except the ones who have fields of
<a href="type-system-overview.html#types-not-support-comparison">uncomparable types</a>.
When comparing two struct values of the same type,
each pair of their corresponding fields will be compared.
The two struct values are equal only if all of their corresponding fields are equal.
</p>

<h3>About Struct Value Conversions</h3>

<div>
<p>
Values of two struct types <code>S1</code> and <code>S2</code> can be converted
to each other's types, if <code>S1</code> and <code>S2</code> share
the identical underlying type (by ignoring field tags).
In particular if either <code>S1</code> or <code>S2</code> is a
<a href="type-system-overview.html#non-defined-type">non-defined type</a>
and their underlying types are identical (considering field tags),
then the conversions between the values of them can be implicit.
</p>

Given struct types <code>S0</code>, <code>S1</code>, <code>S2</code>
<code>S3</code> and <code>S4</code> in the following code snippet,
<ul>
<li>
	values of type <code>S0</code> can't be converted to
	the other four types, and vice versa,
	for the corresponding field names are different.
</li>
<li>
	two values of two different types among <code>S1</code>,
	<code>S2</code>, <code>S3</code> and <code>S4</code>
	can be converted to each other's type.
	In particular, 
	<ul>
	<li>
		values of type <code>S2</code> can be implicitly converted
		to type <code>S3</code>, and vice versa.
	</li>
	<li>
		values of type <code>S2</code> can be implicitly converted
		to type <code>S4</code>, and vice versa.
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

type S0 struct {
	y int "foo"
	x bool
}

type S1 struct { // S1 is a defined type
	x int "foo"
	y bool
}

type S2 = struct { // S2 is a type alias (a non-defined type)
	x int "bar"
	y bool
}
type S3 S2 // S3 is a defined type
type S4 S3 // S4 is a defined type

var v0, v1, v2, v3, v4 = S0{}, S1{}, S2{}, S3{}, S4{}
func f() {
	v1 = S1(v2); v2 = S2(v1)
	v1 = S1(v3); v3 = S3(v1)
	v1 = S1(v4); v4 = S4(v1)
	v2 = v3; v3 = v2 // the conversions can be implicit
	v2 = v4; v4 = v2 // the conversions can be implicit
	v3 = S3(v4); v4 = S4(v3)
}
</code></pre>

</div>

<h3>Annoymous Structs</h3>

<div>

An annoymous struct type are allowed used as the types of the fields
of another struct type.
Annoymous struct type literals are also allowed to be used
in compisite literals.
Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">var aBook = struct {
	author struct {
		firstName, lastName string
		gender              bool
	}
	title string
	pages int
}{
	author: struct {
		firstName, lastName string
		gender              bool
	}{
		firstName: "Mark",
		lastName: "Twain",
	},
	title: "The Million Pound Note",
	pages: 96,
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Generally, it is not recommended to
use annoymous struct type literals in compisite literals.
</p>

</div>
