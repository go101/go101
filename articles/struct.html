<h1>Structs In Go</h1>

<p>
Same as C, Go also supports struct types.
This article will introduce the basic knowledges of struct types and values in Go.
</p>

<h3>Struct Types And Struct Type Literals</h3>

<div>
<p>
Each unnamed struct type literal starts with a <code>struct</code> keyword
which is following by a sequence of field definitions enclosed in a <code>{}</code>.
Each field definition is composed of a name and a type.
The number of fields of a struct type can be zero.
<p>

The following is an unnamed struct type literal:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">struct {
	title  string
	author string
	pages  int
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The above struct type has three fields. The types of the two fields
<code>title</code> and <code>author</code> are both <code>string</code>.
The type of the <code>pages</code> field is <code>int</code>.
</p>

<p>
Some articles also call fields as member variables.
</p>

Consecutive fields with the same type can be declared together.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">struct {
	title, author string
	pages         int
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The size of a struct type is the sum of the sizes of all its field types plus the number of some padding bytes.
The padding bytes are used to align the memory addresses of some fields.
We can learn padding and memory address alignments in <a href="memory-layout.html">a later article</a>.
</p>

<p>
The size of a zero-field struct type is zero.
</p>

Each struct field can be bound with a tag when it is declared.
Field tags are optional, the default value of each field tag is a blank string.
Here is an example showing non-default field tags.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">struct {
	Title  string `json:"title"`
	Author string `json:"author,omitempty"`
	Pages  int    `json:"pages,omitempty"`
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The purpose of each field tag is application dependent.
In the above example, the field tags can help the functions in the
<code>encoding/json</code> standard package to determine the field names in JSON texts,
in the process of encoding struct values into JSON texts or decoding JSON texts into struct values.
The functions in the <code>encoding/json</code> standard package will
only encode and decode the exported struct fields, which is why
the first letters of the field names in the above example are all upper cased.
</p>

<p>
It is not a good idea to use field tags as comments.
</p>

<p>
Raw string literals (<code>`...`</code>) are used more popular than
interpreted string literals (<code>"..."</code>) for field tags in practice.
</p>

<p>
Unlike C language, Go structs don't support unions.
</p>

<p>
All above shown struct types are unnamed, or called anonymous struct types.
In practice, named (defined or alias) struct types are used more popularly.
</p>

<p>
Only exported fields of struct types shown up in a package
can be used in other packages by importing the package.
We can view non-exported struct fileds as private/protected member variables.
</p>

<p>
The field tags and the order of the field declarations in a struct type matter for the identity of the struct type.
Two unnamed struct types are identical only if they have the same sequence of field declarations.
Two field declarations are identical only if their respective names,
their respective types and their respective tags are all identical.
Please note, <b>two non-exported struct field names from
different packages are always viewed as two different names.</b>
</p>

<p>
A struct type can't have a field of the struct type itself, either directly or recursively.

<h3>Struct Value Literals And Struct Value Manipulations</h3>

<p>
In Go, the form <code>T{...}</code>,
where <code>T</code> must be a type literal or a type name,
is called as a <b>composite literal</b> and
is used as the value literals of some kinds of types,
including struct types and the container types introduced later.
</p>

<div>
Given a struct type <code>S</code> and assume it has two fields,
<code>x int</code> and <code>y bool</code> in order,
then the zero value of <code>S</code> can be represented by the following
two variants of struct composite literal forms:
<ol>
<li>
	<code>S{0, false}</code>.
	In this variant, none field names are present but all field values must be present
	by the field declaration orders.
</li>
<li>
	<code>S{x: 0, y: false}</code>, <code>S{y: false, x: 0}</code>,
	<code>S{x: 0}</code>, <code>S{y: false}</code> and <code>S{}</code>.
	In this variant, each field item is optional to be present and the order of the field items is not important.
	The values of the absent fields will be set as the zero values of their respective types.
	But if a field item is present, it must be presented with the <code>FieldName: FieldValue</code> form.
	The order of the field items in this form doesn't matter.
	The form <code>S{}</code> is the most used zero value representation of type <code>S</code>.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
If <code>S</code> is a struct type imported from another package,
it is recommended to use the second form,
for the maintainer of the other package may add new fields for the type <code>S</code> later,
which will make the uses of first forms become invalid.
</p>

<p>
Surely, we can also use the struct composite literals to represent non-zero struct value.
</p>

<p>
For a value <code>v</code> of type <code>S</code>, we can use
<code>v.x</code> and <code>v.y</code>, which are called selectors,
to access the field values of <code>v</code>.
Later, we call the dot <code>.</code> in a selector as the property accessment operator.
</p>

An example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Book struct {
	title, author string
	pages         int
}

func main() {
	book := Book{"Go 101", "Tapir", 256}
	fmt.Println(book) // {Go 101 Tapir 256}

	// Create a book value with another form.
	book = Book{} // title and author are both "", pages is 0
	book = Book{author: "Tapir"} // title is "" and pages is 0
	book = Book{author: "Tapir", pages: 256, title: "Go 101"}

	// Initialize a struct value by using selectors.
	var book2 Book // <=> book2 := Book{}
	book2.author = "Tapir Liu"
	book2.pages = 300
	fmt.Println(book.pages) // 300
}
</code></pre>

<p></p>

The last <code>,</code> in a composite literal is optional
if the last item in the literal and the closing <code>}</code>
are at the same line.
Otherwise, the last <code>,</code> is required.
(For more details, please read
<a href="line-break-rules.html">line break rules in Go</a>.)

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">var _ = Book {
	author: "Go 101",
	pages: 256,
	title: "Go 101", // here, the "," can not be ommitted.
}

// The last "," in the following line can be ommitted.
var _ = Book{author: "Go 101", pages: 256, title: "Go 101",}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<h3>About Struct Value Assignments</h3>

<div>
When a struct value is assigned to another struct value,
the effect is the same as assigning each field one by one.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func f() {
	book1 := Book{pages: 300}
	book2 := Book{"Go 101", "Tapir", 256}

	book2 = book1
	// The above line is equivalent to the following three lines.
	book2.title = book1.title
	book2.author = book1.author
	book2.pages = book1.pages
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Two struct values can be assigned to each other only if
their types are identical or the types of the two struct values
have the identical underlying type (considering field tags)
and at least one of the two types is an
<a href="type-system-overview.html#non-defined-type">non-defined type</a>.
</p>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="field-addressability"></p>
<h3>Struct Field Addressability</h3>

<div>
<p>
The fields of an addressable struct value are also addressable.
The fields of an unaddressable struct value are also unaddressable.
The fields of unaddressable struct values can't be modified.
All composite literals, including struct composite literal are unaddressable.
<p>

Example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	type Book struct {
		Pages int
	}
	var book = Book{} // book is addressable
	p := &book.Pages
	*p = 123
	fmt.Println(book) // {123}

	// The following two lines fail to compile,
	// for Book{}.Pages is not addressable.
	/*
	Book{}.Pages = 123
	p = &(Book{}.Pages) // <=> p = &(Book{}.Pages)
	*/
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Please, the precedence of the property accessment operator <code>.</code>
in a selector is higher than the address-taken operator <code>&amp;</code>.
</p>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="take-composite-literal-address"></p>
<h3>Composite Literals Are Unaddressable But Can Be Taken Addresses</h3>

<div>
<p>
Generally, only addressable values can be taken addresses.
But there is a syntactic sugar in Go, which allows us to
take addesses on composite literals.
A syntactic sugar is an exception in syntax to make programming convenient.
</p>

For example,
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	type Book struct {
		Pages int
	}
	// Book{100} is unaddressable but can be taken address.
	p := &Book{100} // <=> tmp := Book{100}; p := &tmp
	p.Pages = 200
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="anchor" id="use-pointer-as-struct"></p>
<h3>In Selectors, Struct Pointers Can Be Used As Struct Values</h3>

<div>
<p>
Unlike C, in Go, there is not the <code>-&gt;</code> operator for accessing
struct fields through struct pointers.
In Go, the <code>-&gt;</code> operator is also represented with the dot sign <code>.</code>.
</p>

For example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

func main() {
	type Book struct {
		pages int
	}
	book1 := &Book{100} // book1 is a struct poiner
	book2 := new(Book)  // book2 is another struct pointer
	book2.pages = book1.pages // use struct pointers as structs
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

</div>

<p class="anchor" id="comparison"></p>
<h3>About Struct Value Comparisons</h3>

<p>
Most struct types are comparable types, except the ones who have fields of
<a href="type-system-overview.html#types-not-support-comparison">uncomparable types</a>.
</p>

<p>
Two struct values are comparable only if they can be assigned to each other and their types are both comparable.
In other words, two struct values can be compared with each other only if
the (comparable) types of the two struct values
have the identical underlying type (considering field tags)
and at least one of the two types is non-defined.
</p>

<p>
When comparing two struct values of the same type,
each pair of their corresponding fields will be compared.
The two struct values are equal only if all of their corresponding fields are equal.
</p>

<h3>About Struct Value Conversions</h3>

<div>
<p>
Values of two struct types <code>S1</code> and <code>S2</code> can be converted
to each other's types, if <code>S1</code> and <code>S2</code> share
the identical underlying type (by ignoring field tags).
In particular if either <code>S1</code> or <code>S2</code> is a
<a href="type-system-overview.html#non-defined-type">non-defined type</a>
and their underlying types are identical (considering field tags),
then the conversions between the values of them can be implicit.
</p>

Given struct types <code>S0</code>, <code>S1</code>, <code>S2</code>,
<code>S3</code> and <code>S4</code> in the following code snippet,
<ul>
<li>
	values of type <code>S0</code> can't be converted to
	the other four types, and vice versa,
	for the corresponding field names are different.
</li>
<li>
	two values of two different types among <code>S1</code>,
	<code>S2</code>, <code>S3</code> and <code>S4</code>
	can be converted to each other's type.
</li>
</ul>

In particular,
<ul>
<li>
	values of type <code>S2</code> can be implicitly converted
	to type <code>S3</code>, and vice versa.
</li>
<li>
	values of type <code>S2</code> can be implicitly converted
	to type <code>S4</code>, and vice versa.
</li>
</ul>

But,
<ul>
<li>
	values of type <code>S1</code> must be explicitly converted
	to type <code>S2</code>, and vice versa.
</li>
<li>
	values of type <code>S3</code> must be explicitly converted
	to type <code>S4</code>, and vice versa.
</li>
</ul>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

type S0 struct {
	y int "foo"
	x bool
}

type S1 = struct { // S1 is a (non-defined) alias type
	x int "foo"
	y bool
}

type S2 = struct { // S2 is a (non-defined) alias type
	x int "bar"
	y bool
}

// If field tags are ignored, the underlying types of
// S3(S4) and S1 are same. If field tags are considered,
// the underlying types of S3(S4) and S1 are different.
type S3 S2 // S3 is a defined type
type S4 S3 // S4 is a defined type

var v0, v1, v2, v3, v4 = S0{}, S1{}, S2{}, S3{}, S4{}
func f() {
	v1 = S1(v2); v2 = S2(v1)
	v1 = S1(v3); v3 = S3(v1)
	v1 = S1(v4); v4 = S4(v1)
	v2 = v3; v3 = v2 // the conversions can be implicit
	v2 = v4; v4 = v2 // the conversions can be implicit
	v3 = S3(v4); v4 = S4(v3)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
In fact, two struct values can be assigned (or compared) to each other
only if one of them can implicitly converted to the type of the other.
</p>

</div>

<h3>Annoymous Struct Types Can Be Used In Field Declarations</h3>

<div>
<p>
Annoymous struct types are allowed used as the types of the fields
of another struct type.
Annoymous struct type literals are also allowed to be used
in composite literals.
</p>

An example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">var aBook = struct {
	author struct { // the type of this field is an anonymous struct type
		firstName, lastName string
		gender              bool
	}
	title string
	pages int
}{
	author: struct {
		firstName, lastName string
		gender              bool
	}{
		firstName: "Mark",
		lastName: "Twain",
	}, // the type in the composite literal is an anonymous struct type
	title: "The Million Pound Note",
	pages: 96,
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Generally, for better readibility, it is not recommended to
use annoymous struct type literals in compisite literals.
</p>

</div>
