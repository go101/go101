<h1>Concurrency Synchronization Techniques Provided in the <code>sync</code> Standard Package</h1>

<p>
The <a href="channel-use-cases.html">channel use cases</a> article introduces
many use cases in which channels are used to do data synchronizations among goroutines.
In fact, channels are not the only synchronization techniques provided in Go.
There are some other synchronization techniques supported by Go.
For some specified circumstances, using the synchronization techniques
other than channel are more efficient and readable than using channels.
Below will introduce the synchronization techniques provided
in the <code>sync</code> standard package.
</p>

<p>
The <code>sync</code> standard package provides several types
which can be used to do synchronizations for some specialized circumstances
and guarantee some specialized memory orders.
For the specialized circumstances, these techniques are more efficient,
and look cleaner, than the channel ways.
</p>

<p><i>
(Please note, to avoid abnormal behaviors, it is best never to copy
the values of the types in the <code>sync</code> standard package.)

<h3>The <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> Type</h3>

<div>
<p>
Each <code>sync.WaitGroup</code> value maintains a counter internally.
The initial value of the counter is zero.
</p>

<p>
The <code>*WaitGroup</code> type has
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup">three methods</a>:
<code>Add(delta int)</code>, <code>Done()</code> and <code>Wait()</code>.
</p>

For an addressable <code>WaitGroup</code> value <code>wg</code>,
<ul>
<li>
	we can call the <code>wg.Add(delta)</code> method to
	change the counter value maintained by <code>wg</code>.
</li>
<li>
	the method call <code>wg.Done()</code> is totally equivalent to
	the method call <code>wg.Add(-1)</code>.
</li>
<li>
	if a call <code>wg.Add(delta)</code> (or <code>wg.Done()</code>) modifies
	the counter maintained by <code>wg</code> to negative,  panic will happen.
</li>
<li>
	when a goroutine calls <code>wg.Wait()</code>,
	<ul>
	<li>
		if the counter maintained by <code>wg</code> is already zero,
		then the call <code>wg.Wait()</code> can be viewed as a no-op.
	</li>
	<li>
		otherwise (the counter is positive), the goroutine will enter blocking state.
		It will enter running state again (a.k.a., the call <code>wg.Wait()</code> returns)
		when another goroutine modifies the counter to zero,
		generally by calling <code>wg.Done()</code>.
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please note that <code>wg.Add(delta)</code>, <code>wg.Done()</code> and <code>wg.Wait()</code>
are shorthands of <code>(&amp;wg).Add(delta)</code>, <code>(&amp;wg).Done()</code>
and <code>(&amp;wg).Wait()</code>, respectively.
</p>

Generally, a <code>WaitGroup</code> value is used for the scenario that
one goroutine waits until all of several other goroutines finish their respective jobs.
An example:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"log"
	"math/rand"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

	const N = 5
	var values [N]int32

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(N)
	for i := 0; i < N; i++ {
		i := i
		go func() {
			values[i] = 50 + rand.Int31n(50)
			log.Println("Done:", i)
			wg.Done() // <=> wg.Add(-1)
		}()
	}

	wg.Wait()
	// All elements are guaranteed to be
	// initialized now.
	log.Println("values:", values)
}
</code></pre>

In the above example, the main goroutine waits until all other <code>N</code> goroutines
have populated their respective element value in <code>values</code> array.
Here is one possible output result:
<pre class="output"><code>Done: 4
Done: 1
Done: 3
Done: 0
Done: 2
values: [71 89 50 62 60]
</code></pre>

We can split the only <code>Add</code> method call in the above example into multiple ones.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">...
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	for i := 0; i < N; i++ {
		wg.Add(1) // will be invoked N times
		i := i
		go func() {
			values[i] = 50 + rand.Int31n(50)
			wg.Done()
		}()
	}
...
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

The <code>Wait</code> method can be called in multiple goroutines.
When the counter becomes zero, all of them will be notified, in a broadcast way.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

	const N = 5
	var values [N]int32

	var wgA, wgB sync.WaitGroup
	wgA.Add(N)
	wgB.Add(1)

	for i := 0; i < N; i++ {
		i := i
		go func() {
			wgB.Wait() // wait a notification
			log.Printf("values[%v]=%v \n", i, values[i])
			wgA.Done()
		}()
	}

	// The loop is guaranteed to finish before
	// any above wg.Wait calls returns.
	for i := 0; i < N; i++ {
		values[i] = 50 + rand.Int31n(50)
	}
	// Make a broadcast notification.
	wgB.Done()
	wgA.Wait()
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>
A <code>WaitGroup</code> value can be reused after one call to its <code>Wait</code> method returns.
But please note that each <code>Add</code> method call with a positive delta that occurs
when the counter is zero must happen before any <code>Wait</code> call starts,
otherwise, data races may happen.
</p>

</div>

<a class="anchor" id="once"></a>
<h3>The <code>sync.Once</code> Type</h3>

<div>
<p>
A <code>*sync.Once</code> value has a <code>Do(f func())</code> method,
which takes a solo parameter with type <code>func()</code>.
</p>

<p>
For an addressable <code>Once</code> value <code>o</code>,
the method call <code>o.Do()</code>, which is a shorthand of <code>(&amp;o).Do()</code>,
can be concurrently executed multiple times, in multiple goroutines.
The arguments of these <code>o.Do()</code> calls should
(but are not required to) be the same function value.
</p>

<p>
Among these <code>o.Do</code> method calls, only exact one argument function will be invoked.
The invoked argument function is guaranteed to exit before
any <code>o.Do</code> method call returns.
In other words, the code in the invoked argument function
is guaranteed to be executed before any <code>o.Do</code> method call returns.
</p>

<p>
Generally, a <code>Once</code> value is used to ensure that
a piece of code will be executed exactly once in concurrent programming.
</p>

An example:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"log"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	log.SetFlags(0)

	x := 0
	doSomething := func() {
		x++
		log.Println("Hello")
	}

	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	var once sync.Once
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func() {
			defer wg.Done()
			once.Do(doSomething)
			log.Println("world!")
		}()
	}

	wg.Wait()
	log.Println("x =", x) // x = 1
}
</code></pre>

<p>
In the above example, <code>Hello</code> will be printed once,
but <code>world!</code> will be printed five times.
And <code>Hello</code> is guaranteed to be printed before all five <code>world!</code>.
</p>

</div>

<a class="anchor" id="mutex"></a>
<h3>The <code>sync.Mutex</code> and <code>sync.RWMutex</code> Types</h3>

<div>
<p>
Both of the <code>*sync.Mutex</code> and <code>*sync.RWMutex</code> types implement
<a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Locker">the <code>sync.Locker</code> interface</a>.
So they both have two methods, <code>Lock</code> and <code>Unlock</code>,
to prevent multiple data users from using a piece of data concurrently.
</p>

<p>
Besides the <code>Lock</code> and <code>Unlock</code> methods,
the <code>*RWMutex</code> type has two other methods,
<code>RLock</code> and <code>RUnlock</code>,
to avoid some data users (either writers or readers) and one data writer using a piece of data at the same time
but allow some data readers to access the piece of data at the same time.
</p>

<p><i>
(Note, here the terminologies <b><i>data reader</i></b> and <b><i>data writer</i></b>
should not be interpreted from literal. They are just used for explanation purpose.
A data reader might modify data and a data writer might only read data.)
</i></p>

<p>
A <code>Mutex</code> value is often called a mutual exclusion lock.
A zero <code>Mutex</code> value is an unlocked mutex.
A <code>Mutex</code> value can only be locked when it is in unlocked status.
In other words, once an addressable <code>Mutex</code> value <code>m</code> is locked successfully
(a.k.a., a <code>m.Lock()</code> method call returns),
a new attempt by a goroutine to lock the <code>Mutex</code> value will make the goroutine enter blocking state,
until the <code>Mutex</code> value is unlocked (through a later <code>m.Unlock()</code> call).
</p>

<p>
Please note that <code>m.Lock()</code> and <code>m.Unlock()</code>
are shorthands of <code>(&amp;m).Lock()</code> and <code>(&amp;m).Unlock()</code>, respectively.
</p>

An example of using <code>sync.Mutex</code>:
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"runtime"
	"sync"
)

type Counter struct {
	m sync.Mutex
	n uint64
}

func (c *Counter) Value() uint64 {
	c.m.Lock()
	defer c.m.Unlock()
	return c.n
}

func (c *Counter) Increase(delta uint64) {
	c.m.Lock()
	c.n += delta
	c.m.Unlock()
}

func main() {
	var c Counter
	for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
		go func() {
			for k := 0; k < 100; k++ {
				c.Increase(1)
			}
		}()
	}

	// The loop is just for demo purpose.
	for c.Value() < 10000 {
		runtime.Gosched()
	}
	fmt.Println(c.Value()) // 10000
}
</code></pre>

<p>
In the above example, a <code>Counter</code> value uses a <code>Mutex</code> field
to guarantee that the <code>n</code> field of the <code>Counter</code> value
will be never used by multiple goroutines at the same time.
</p>

<p>
A <code>RWMutex</code> value is often called a reader+writer mutual exclusion lock.
It has two locks, the write lock and the read lock.
The locks of a zero <code>RWMutex</code> value are both unlocked.
For an addressable <code>RWMutex</code> value <code>rwm</code>,
data writers can lock the write lock of <code>rwm</code> through <code>rwm.Lock()</code> method calls,
and data readers can lock the read lock of <code>rwm</code> through <code>rwm.RLock()</code> method calls.
Method calls <code>rwm.Unlock()</code> and <code>rwm.RUnlock()</code>
are used to unlock the write and read locks of <code>rwm</code>.
The read lock of <code>rwm</code> maintains a lock count, which increases by one
when <code>rwm.Lock()</code> is called successfully and decreases by one
when <code>rwm.Unlock()</code> is called successfully.
A zero lock count means the read lock is in unlocked status
and a non-zero one (must be larger than one) means the read lock is locked.
</p>

<p>
Please note that <code>rwm.Lock()</code>, <code>rwm.Unlock()</code>,
<code>rwm.RLock()</code> and <code>rwm.RUnlock()</code>
are shorthands of <code>(&amp;m).Lock()</code>, <code>(&amp;m).Unlock()</code>,
<code>(&amp;m).RLock()</code> and <code>(&amp;m).RUnlock()</code>, respectively.
</p>

For an addressable <code>RWMutex</code> value <code>rwm</code>, the following rules exist.
<ul>
<li>
	The write lock of <code>rwm</code> may be locked only if neither of
	the read lock and write lock of <code>rwm</code> is in locked status.
	In other words, the write lock of <code>rwm</code> may only be held by at most one writer at any given time,
	and the read lock and write lock of <code>rwm</code> may not be held at the same time.
</li>
<li>
	When the write lock of <code>rwm</code> is in locked status, any newer
	attempts to lock the write lock or the read lock of <code>rwm</code>
	will be blocked until the initial write lock is unlocked.
</li>
<li>
	When the read lock of <code>rwm</code> is in locked status,
	any newer attempts to lock the write lock will be blocked
	untile the read lock is unlocked.
	However, newer attempts to lock the read lock will succeed
	as long as the attempts are performed before any blocked attempts to lock the write lock
	(see the next rule for details). 
	In other words, the read lock may be held by more than one readers at a time.
	The read lock will return to unlocked status when its lock count returns to zero. 
</li>
<li>
	Assume the read lock of the value <code>rwm</code> is in locked status now,
	to avoid endless read locking, any newer attempts to lock the read lock after
	the a being blocked attempt to lock the write lock will be blocked.
</li>
<li>
	Assume the write lock of the value <code>rwm</code> is in locked status now,
	for the official standard Go compiler, to avoid endless write locking,
	the attempts to lock the read lock before releasing the write lock will succeed for sure
	once the write lock is unlocked, even if some of the attempts are made
	after some still being blocked attempts to lock the write lock.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The last two rules are to ensure both readers and writers have chances to acquire locks.
</p>

<p>
Please note, locks are not bound to goroutines.
A lock may be locked in one goroutine and unlocked in another one later.
In other words, a lock doesn't know which goroutine successfully locked or unlocked it.
</p>

-->

The type of the <code>m</code> field of the <code>Counter</code> type in the last example
can be changed to <code>sync.RWMutex</code>, as the following code shows, to get a better performance
when the <code>Value</code> method is called very frequently but the <code>Increase</code> method
is called not frequently.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">...
type Counter struct {
	//m sync.Mutex
	m sync.RWMutex
	n uint64
}

func (c *Counter) Value() uint64 {
	//c.m.Lock()
	//defer c.m.Unlock()
	c.m.RLock()
	defer c.m.RUnlock()
	return c.n
}
...
</code></pre>

<p>
Another use scenario of <code>sync.RWMutex</code> values is to slice a write job into several small ones.
Please read the next section for an example.
</p>

By the last two rules mentioned above, the following program is very possible to output <code>abdc</code>.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	var m sync.RWMutex
	go func() {
		m.RLock()
		fmt.Print("a")
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		m.RUnlock()
	}()
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 1 / 4)
		m.Lock()
		fmt.Print("b")
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		m.Unlock()
	}()
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 2 / 4)
		m.Lock()
		fmt.Print("c")
		m.Unlock()
	}()
	go func () {
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 3 / 4)
		m.RLock()
		fmt.Print("d")
		m.RUnlock()
	}()
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 3)
	fmt.Println()
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Please note, the above example is only for explanation purpose.
It uses <code>time.Sleep</code> calls to do concurrency synchronizations,
which is <a href="concurrent-common-mistakes.html#sleep">a bad practice for production code</a>.
</p>

<code>sync.Mutex</code> and <code>sync.RWMutex</code> values can also be used to make notifications,
though there are many other better ways to do the same job.
Here is an example which makes a notification by using a <code>sync.Mutex</code> value.
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	var m sync.Mutex
	m.Lock()
	go func() {
		time.Sleep(time.Second)
		fmt.Println("Hi")
		m.Unlock() // make a notification
	}()
	m.Lock() // wait to be notified
	fmt.Println("Bye")
}
</code></pre>

<p>
In the above example, the text <code>Hi</code> is guaranteed to
be printed before the text <code>Bye</code>.
About the memory order guarantees made by
<code>sync.Mutex</code> and <code>sync.RWMutex</code> values,
please read <a href="memory-model.html#mutex">memory order guarantees in Go</a>.
</p>

</div>

<a class="anchor" id="cond"></a>
<h3>The <code>sync.Cond</code> Type</h3>

<div>
<p>
The <code>sync.Cond</code> type provides an efficient way
to do notifications among goroutines.
</p>

<p>
Each <code>sync.Cond</code> value holds a <code>sync.Locker</code> field with name <code>L</code>.
The field value is often a value of type <code>*sync.Mutex</code> or <code>*sync.RWMutex</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>*sync.Cond</code> type has <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Cond">three methods</a>,
<code>Wait()</code>, <code>Signal()</code> and <code>Broadcast()</code>.
</p>

Each <code>sync.Cond</code> value also maintains a FIFO (first in first out) waiting goroutine queue.
For an addressable <code>sync.Cond</code> value <code>c</code>,
<ul>
<li>
	<code>c.Wait()</code> must be called when <code>c.L</code> is locked,
	otherwise, a <code>c.Wait()</code> will cause panic.
	A <code>c.Wait()</code> call will
	<ol>
	<li>
		first push the current caller goroutine into
		the waiting goroutine queue maintained by <code>c</code>,
	</li>
	<li>
		then call <code>c.L.Unlock()</code> to unlock/unhold the lock <code>c.L</code>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
		then make the current caller goroutine enter blocking state. <!--sup>(1)</sup-->
		</p>

		<p><i>
		(The caller goroutine will be unblocked by another goroutine
		through calling <code>c.Signal()</code> or <code>c.Broadcast()</code> later.)
		</i></p>

		<p>
		</p>
		Once the caller goroutine is unblocked and enters running state again,
		<code>c.L.Lock()</code> will be called (in the resumed <code>c.Wait()</code> call)
		to try to lock and hold the lock <code>c.L</code> again,
		The <code>c.Wait()</code> call will exit after
		the <code>c.L.Lock()</code> call returns.
	</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li>
	a <code>c.Signal()</code> call will unblock the first goroutine in (and
	remove it from) the waiting goroutine queue maintained by <code>c</code>,
	if the queue is not empty.
</li>
<li>
	a <code>c.Broadcast()</code> call will unblock all the goroutines in (and
	remove them from) the waiting goroutine queue maintained by <code>c</code>,
	if the queue is not empty.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please note that <code>c.Wait()</code>, <code>c.Signal()</code> and <code>c.Broadcast()</code>
are shorthands of <code>(&amp;c).Wait()</code>, <code>(&amp;c).Signal()</code>
and <code>(&amp;c).Broadcast()</code>, respectively.
</p>

<p>
<code>c.Signal()</code> and <code>c.Broadcast()</code> are often used to notify the status of a condition is changed,
Generally, <code>c.Wait()</code> should be called in a loop of checking whether or not a condition has got satisfied.
</p>

<!--
<sup>(1)</sup> This is for the most common case,
by assuming that <code>c.Signal()</code> and <code>c.Broadcast()</code> are not called
in the short period between the step 2 and step 3.

<ul>
<li>
If <code>c.Signal()</code> is called in the short period between the step 2 and step 3,
then the caller goroutine of <code>c.Wait()</code> might not enter blocking state.
</li>
<li>
If <code>c.Broadcast()</code> is called in the short period between the step 2 and step 3,
then the caller goroutine of <code>c.Wait()</code> will not enter blocking state for sure.
</li>
</ul>
-->

In an idiomatic <code>sync.Cond</code> use case, generally,
one goroutine waits for changes of a certain condition,
and some other goroutines change the condition and send notifications.
Here is an example:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

	const N = 10
	var values [N]string

	cond := sync.NewCond(&sync.Mutex{})

	for i := 0; i < N; i++ {
		d := time.Second * time.Duration(rand.Intn(10)) / 10
		go func(i int) {
			time.Sleep(d) // simulate a workload

			// Changes must be made when
			// cond.L is locked.
			cond.L.Lock()
			values[i] = string('a' + i)

			// Notify when cond.L lock is locked.
			cond.Broadcast()
			cond.L.Unlock()

			// "cond.Broadcast()" can also be put
			// here, when cond.L lock is unlocked.
			//cond.Broadcast()
		}(i)
	}

	// This function must be called when
	// cond.L is locked.
	checkCondition := func() bool {
		fmt.Println(values)
		for i := 0; i < N; i++ {
			if values[i] == "" {
				return false
			}
		}
		return true
	}

	cond.L.Lock()
	defer cond.L.Unlock()
	for !checkCondition() {
		// Must be called when cond.L is locked.
		cond.Wait()
	}
}
</code></pre>

One possible output:
<pre class="output"><code>[         ]
[     f    ]
[  c   f    ]
[  c   f  h  ]
[ b c   f  h  ]
[a b c   f  h  j]
[a b c   f g h i j]
[a b c  e f g h i j]
[a b c d e f g h i j]
</code></pre>

<p>
For there is only one goroutine (the main goroutine) waiting to be unblocked in this example,
the <code>cond.Broadcast()</code> call can be replaced with <code>cond.Signal()</code>.
As the comments suggest,
<code>cond.Broadcast()</code> and <code>cond.Signal()</code> are not required to be called
when <code>cond.L</code> is locked.
</p>

<p>
To avoid data races,
each of the ten parts of the user defined condition should only be modified
when <code>cond.L</code> is locked.
The <code>checkCondition</code> function and the <code>cond.Wait</code> method should be also called
when <code>cond.L</code> is locked.
</p>

<p>
In fact, for the above specified example, the <code>cond.L</code> field can also be a <code>*sync.RWMutex</code> value,
and each of the ten parts of the user defined condition can be modified when the read lock of <code>cond.L</code> is held,
just as the following code shows:
</p>

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">...
	cond := sync.NewCond(&sync.RWMutex{})
	cond.L.Lock()

	for i := 0; i < N; i++ {
		d := time.Second * time.Duration(rand.Intn(10)) / 10
		go func(i int) {
			time.Sleep(d)
			cond.L.(*sync.RWMutex).RLock()
			values[i] = string('a' + i)
			cond.L.(*sync.RWMutex).RUnlock()
			cond.Signal()
		}(i)
	}
...
</code></pre>

<p>
In the above example, the <code>sync.RWMutex</code> value is used unusually.
Its read lock is held by some goroutines which modify array elements,
and its write lock is used by the main goroutine to read array elements.
</p>

The user defined condition monitored by a <code>Cond</code> value can be a void.
For such cases, the <code>Cond</code> value is used for notifications purely.
For example, the following program will print <code>abc</code> or <code>bac</code>.

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	wg := sync.WaitGroup{}
	wg.Add(1)
	cond := sync.NewCond(&sync.Mutex{})
	cond.L.Lock()
	go func() {
		cond.L.Lock()
		go func() {
			cond.L.Lock()
			cond.Broadcast()
			cond.L.Unlock()
		}()
		cond.Wait()
		fmt.Print("a")
		cond.L.Unlock()
		wg.Done()
	}()
	cond.Wait()
	fmt.Print("b")
	cond.L.Unlock()
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("c")
}
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>
