Channels in Go</h1>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Channel is an important built-in feature in Go. It is one of the features that makes Go unique. Along with another unique feature, <a href="control-flows-more.html#goroutine">goroutine</a>, channel makes concurrent programming convenient, fun and lowers the difficulties of concurrent programming.
</div>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Channel mainly acts as a <a href="control-flows-more.html#synchronization">concurrency synchronization</a> technique. This article will list all the channel related concepts, syntax and rules. To understand channels better, the internal structure of channels and some implementation details by the standard Go compiler/runtime are also simply described.

<h3 class="tmd-header-3">
Channel Introduction</h3>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
One suggestion (made by <span class="tmd-italic">Rob Pike</span>) for concurrent programming is <span class="tmd-bold">don't (let computations) communicate by sharing memory, (let them) share memory by communicating (through channels)</span>. (We can view each computation as a goroutine in Go programming.)
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Communicating by sharing memory and sharing memory by communicating are two programming manners in concurrent programming. When goroutines communicate by sharing memory, we use traditional concurrency synchronization techniques, such as mutex locks, to protect the shared memory to prevent data races. We can use channels to implement sharing memory by communicating.
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Go provides a unique concurrency synchronization technique, channel. Channels make goroutines share memory by communicating. We can view a channel as an internal FIFO (first in, first out) queue within a program. Some goroutines send values to the queue (the channel) and some other goroutines receive values from the queue.
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Along with transferring values (through channels), the ownership of some values may also be transferred between goroutines. When a goroutine sends a value to a channel, we can view the goroutine releases the ownership of some values (which could be accessed through the sent value). When a goroutine receives a value from a channel, we can view the goroutine acquires the ownership of some values (which could be accessed through the received value).
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Surely, there may also not be any ownership transferred along with channel communications.
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
The values (whose ownerships are transferred) are often referenced (but are not required to be referenced) by the transferred value. Please note, here, when we talk about ownership, we mean the ownership from the logic view. Go channels can help programmers write data races free code easily, but Go channels can't prevent programmers from writing bad concurrent code from the syntax level.
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Although Go also supports traditional concurrency synchronization techniques. only channel is first-class citizen in Go. Channel is one kind of types in Go, so we can use channels without importing any packages. On the other hand, those traditional concurrency synchronization techniques are provided in the <code class="tmd-code-span">sync</code> and <code class="tmd-code-span">sync/atomic</code> standard packages.
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Honestly, each concurrency synchronization technique has its own best use scenarios. But channel has <a href="channel-use-cases.html">a wider application range and has more variety in using</a>. One problem of channels is, the experience of programming with channels is so enjoyable and fun that programmers often even prefer to use channels for the scenarios which channels are not best for.
</div>

<h3 class="tmd-header-3">
Channel Types and Values</h3>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Like array, slice and map, each channel type has an element type. A channel can only transfer values of the element type of the channel.
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Channel types can be bi-directional or single-directional. Assume <code class="tmd-code-span">T</code> is an arbitrary type,
</div>

<ol class="tmd-list">
<li class="tmd-list-item">

<div class="tmd-usual">
<code class="tmd-code-span">chan T</code> denotes a bidirectional channel type. Compilers allow both receiving values from and sending values to bidirectional channels.
</div>

</li>

<li class="tmd-list-item">

<div class="tmd-usual">
<code class="tmd-code-span">chan&lt;- T</code> denotes a send-only channel type. Compilers don't allow receiving values from send-only channels.
</div>

</li>

<li class="tmd-list-item">

<div class="tmd-usual">
<code class="tmd-code-span">&lt;-chan T</code> denotes a receive-only channel type. Compilers don't allow sending values to receive-only channels.
</div>

</li>

</ol>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
<code class="tmd-code-span">T</code> is called the element type of these channel types.
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Values of bidirectional channel type <code class="tmd-code-span">chan T</code> can be implicitly converted to both send-only type <code class="tmd-code-span">chan&lt;- T</code> and receive-only type <code class="tmd-code-span">&lt;-chan T</code>, but not vice versa (even if explicitly). Values of send-only type <code class="tmd-code-span">chan&lt;- T</code> can't be converted to receive-only type <code class="tmd-code-span">&lt;-chan T</code>, and vice versa. Note that the <code class="tmd-code-span">&lt;-</code> signs in channel type literals are modifiers.
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Each channel value has a capacity, which will be explained in the section after next. A channel value with a zero capacity is called unbuffered channel and a channel value with a non-zero capacity is called buffered channel.
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
The zero values of channel types are represented with the predeclared identifier <code class="tmd-code-span">nil</code>. A non-nil channel value must be created by using the built-in <code class="tmd-code-span">make</code> function. For example, <code class="tmd-code-span">make(chan int, 10)</code> will create a channel whose element type is <code class="tmd-code-span">int</code>. The second argument of the <code class="tmd-code-span">make</code> function call specifies the capacity of the new created channel. The second parameter is optional and its default value is zero.
</div>

<p></p>

<h3 class="tmd-header-3">
Channel Value Comparisons</h3>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
All channel types are comparable types.
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
From the article <a href="value-part.html">value parts</a>, we know that non-nil channel values are multi-part values. If one channel value is assigned to another, the two channels share the same underlying part(s). In other words, those two channels represent the same internal channel object. The result of comparing them is <code class="tmd-code-span">true</code>.
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">

</div>

<p></p>

<h3 class="tmd-header-3">
Channel Operations</h3>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
There are five channel specified operations. Assume the channel is <code class="tmd-code-span">ch</code>, their syntax and function calls of these operations are listed here.
</div>

<ol class="tmd-list">
<li class="tmd-list-item">

<div class="tmd-usual">
Close the channel by using the following function call
</div>
<pre class="tmd-code disable-line-numbers111"><code class="language-go">close(ch)
</code></pre>

<div class="tmd-usual">
where <code class="tmd-code-span">close</code> is a built-in function. The argument of a <code class="tmd-code-span">close</code> function call must be a channel value, and the channel <code class="tmd-code-span">ch</code> must not be a receive-only channel.
</div>

</li>

<li class="tmd-list-item">

<div class="tmd-usual">
Send a value, <code class="tmd-code-span">v</code>, to the channel by using the following syntax
</div>
<pre class="tmd-code disable-line-numbers111"><code class="language-go">ch &lt;- v
</code></pre>

<div class="tmd-usual">
where <code class="tmd-code-span">v</code> must be a value which is assignable to the element type of channel <code class="tmd-code-span">ch</code>, and the channel <code class="tmd-code-span">ch</code> must not be a receive-only channel. Note that here <code class="tmd-code-span">&lt;-</code> is a channel-send operator.
</div>

</li>

<li class="tmd-list-item">

<div class="tmd-usual">
Receive a value from the channel by using the following syntax
</div>
<pre class="tmd-code disable-line-numbers111"><code class="language-go">&lt;-ch
</code></pre>

<div class="tmd-usual">
A channel receive operation always returns at least one result, which is a value of the element type of the channel, and the channel <code class="tmd-code-span">ch</code> must not be a send-only channel. Note that here <code class="tmd-code-span">&lt;-</code> is a channel-receive operator. Yes, its representation is the same as a channel-send operator.
</div>

<div class="tmd-usual">
<p></p>
For most scenarios, a channel receive operation is viewed as a single-value expression. However, when a channel operation is used as the only source value expression in an assignment, it can result a second optional untyped boolean value and become a multi-value expression. The untyped boolean value indicates whether or not the first result is sent before the channel is closed. (Below we will learn that we can receive unlimited number of values from a closed channel.)
</div>

<div class="tmd-usual">
<p></p>
Two channel receive operations which are used as source values in assignments:
</div>
<pre class="tmd-code disable-line-numbers111"><code class="language-go">v = &lt;-ch
v, sentBeforeClosed = &lt;-ch
</code></pre>

</li>

<li class="tmd-list-item">

<div class="tmd-usual">
Query the value buffer capacity of the channel by using the following function call
</div>
<pre class="tmd-code disable-line-numbers111"><code class="language-go">cap(ch)
</code></pre>

<div class="tmd-usual">
where <code class="tmd-code-span">cap</code> is a built-in function which has ever been introduced in <a href="container.html#cap-len">containers in Go</a>. The return result of a <code class="tmd-code-span">cap</code> function call is an <code class="tmd-code-span">int</code> value.
</div>

</li>

<li class="tmd-list-item">

<div class="tmd-usual">
Query the current number of values in the value buffer (or the length) of the channel by using the following function call
</div>
<pre class="tmd-code disable-line-numbers111"><code class="language-go">len(ch)
</code></pre>

<div class="tmd-usual">
where <code class="tmd-code-span">len</code> is a built-in function which also has ever been introduced before. The return value of a <code class="tmd-code-span">len</code> function call is an <code class="tmd-code-span">int</code> value. The result length is the number of elements which have already been sent successfully to the queried channel but haven't been received (taken out) yet.
</div>

</li>

</ol>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Most basic operations in Go are not synchronized. In other words, they are not concurrency-safe. These operations include value assignments, argument passing and container element manipulations, etc. However, all the just introduced channel operations are already synchronized, so no further synchronizations are needed to safely perform these operations.
</div>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Like most other operations in Go, channel value assignments are not synchronized. Similarly, assigning the received value to another value is also not synchronized, though any channel receive operation is synchronized.
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
If the queried channel is a nil channel, both of the built-in <code class="tmd-code-span">cap</code> and <code class="tmd-code-span">len</code> functions return zero. The two query operations are so simple that they will not get further explanations later. In fact, the two operations are seldom used in practice.

<div class="tmd-usual">
Channel send, receive and close operations will be explained in detail in the next section.

<h3 class="tmd-header-3">
Detailed Explanations for Channel Operations</h3>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
To make the explanations for channel operations simple and clear, in the remaining of this article, channels will be classified into three categories:
</div>

<ol class="tmd-list">
<li class="tmd-list-item">

<div class="tmd-usual">
nil channels.

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">

The following will make more explanations for the four cases shown with superscripts (A, B, C and D).

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
To better understand channel types and values, and to make some explanations easier, looking in the raw internal structures of internal channel objects is very helpful.
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
We can think of each channel consisting of three queues (all can be viewed as FIFO queues) internally:
</div>

<ol class="tmd-list">
<li class="tmd-list-item">

<div class="tmd-usual">
the receiving goroutine queue (generally FIFO). The queue is a linked list without size limitation. Goroutines in this queue are all in blocking state and waiting to receive values from that channel.
</div>

</li>

<li class="tmd-list-item">

<div class="tmd-usual">
the sending goroutine queue (generally FIFO). The queue is also a linked list without size limitation. Goroutines in this queue are all in blocking state and waiting to send values to that channel. The value (or the address of the value, depending on compiler implementation) each goroutine is trying to send is also stored in the queue along with that goroutine.
</div>

</li>

<li class="tmd-list-item">

<div class="tmd-usual">
the value buffer queue (absolutely FIFO). This is a circular queue. Its size is equal to the capacity of the channel. The types of the values stored in this buffer queue are all the element type of that channel. If the current number of values stored in the value buffer queue of the channel reaches the capacity of the channel, the channel is called in full status. If no values are stored in the value buffer queue of the channel currently, the channel is called in empty status. For a zero-capacity (unbuffered) channel, it is always in both full and empty status.
</div>

</li>

</ol>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Each channel internally holds a mutex lock which is used to avoid data races in all kinds of operations.

<div class="tmd-usual">
If the value buffer queue of the channel is not empty, in which case the receiving goroutine queue of the channel must be empty, the goroutine <code class="tmd-code-span">R</code> will receive (by shifting) a value from the value buffer queue.

Channel Element Values Are Transferred by Copy</h3>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
When a value is transferred from one goroutine to another goroutine, the value will be copied at least one time. If the transferred value ever stayed in the value buffer of a channel, then two copies will happen in the transfer process. One copy happens when the value is copied from the sender goroutine into the value buffer, the other happens when the value is copied from the value buffer to the receiver goroutine. Like value assignments and function argument passing, when a value is transferred, <a href="value-part.html#about-value-copy">only its direct part is copied</a>.
</div>

<div class="tmd-usual">

</div>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
For the standard Go compiler, the size of channel element types must be smaller than <code class="tmd-code-span">65536</code>. However, generally, we shouldn't create channels with large-size element types, to avoid too large copy cost in the process of transferring values between goroutines. So if the passed value size is too large, it is best to use a pointer element type instead, to avoid a large value copy cost.

About Channel and Goroutine Garbage Collections</h3>

<p></p>

<div class="tmd-usual">
Note, a channel is referenced by all the goroutines in either the sending or the receiving goroutine queue of the channel, so if neither of the queues of the channel is empty, the channel cannot be garbage collected. On the other hand, if a goroutine is blocked and stays in either the sending or the receiving goroutine queue of a channel, then the goroutine also cannot be garbage collected, even if the channel is referenced only by this goroutine. In fact, a goroutine can only be garbage collected when it has already exited.

<div class="tmd-usual">
The <code class="tmd-code-span">for-range</code> control flow code block applies to channels. The loop will try to iteratively receive the values sent to a channel, until the channel is closed and its value buffer queue becomes blank. With <code class="tmd-code-span">for-range</code> syntax on arrays, slices and maps, multiple iteration variables are allowed. However, for <code class="tmd-code-span">for-range</code> blocks applied to channels, you can use at most one iteration variable, which is used to store the received values.
