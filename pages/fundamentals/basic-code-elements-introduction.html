Introduction to Source Code Elements

<div class="tmd-usual">
Go is known for its simple and clean syntax. This article introduces the common source code elements in programming through a simple example. This will help new gophers (Go programmers) get a basic idea of the usage of Go elements.

Programming and Source Code Elements
</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Programming can be viewed as manipulating operations in all kinds of ways to reach certain goals. Operations write data to and read data from hardware devices to complete tasks. For modern computers, elemental operations are low-level CPU and GPU instructions. Common hardware devices include memory, disk, network card, graphics card, monitor, keyboard and mouse, etc.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Programming by manipulating low-level instructions directly is tedious and error-prone. High-level programming languages make some encapsulations for low-level operations, and make some abstracts for data, to make programming more intuitive and human-friendly.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
In popular high-level programming languages, operations are mainly achieved by calling <span class="tmd-bold">functions</span> and using <span class="tmd-bold">operators</span>. Most popular high-level programming languages support several kinds of conditional and loop <span class="tmd-bold">control flows</span>, we can think of them as special operations. The syntax of these control flows is close to human language so that the code written by programmers is easy to understand.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Data is abstracted as <span class="tmd-bold">types</span> and <span class="tmd-bold">values</span> in most high-level programming languages. Types can be viewed as value templates, and values can be viewed as type instances. Most languages support several built-in types, and also support custom types. The type system of a programming language is the spirit of the language.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
There may be a large number of values used in programming. Some of them can be represented with their <span class="tmd-bold">literals</span> (text representations) directly, but others can't. To make programming flexible and less error-prone, many values are named. Such values include <span class="tmd-bold">variables</span> and named <span class="tmd-bold">constants</span>.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Named functions, named values (including variables and named constants), defined types and type alias are called <span class="tmd-bold">code elements</span>. The names of code elements must be <span class="tmd-bold"></span><a href="keywords-and-identifiers.html#identifier"><span class="tmd-bold">identifiers</span></a><span class="tmd-bold"></span>. Package names and package import names shall also be identifiers.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">

</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
High-level programming code will be translated to low-level CPU instructions by compilers to get executed. To help compilers parse high-level programming code, many words are reserved to prevent them from being used as identifiers. Such words are called <span class="tmd-bold"></span><a href="keywords-and-identifiers.html#keyword"><span class="tmd-bold">keywords</span></a><span class="tmd-bold"></span>.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">

</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Many modern high-level programming languages use <span class="tmd-bold">packages</span> to organize code. A package must <span class="tmd-bold">import</span> another package to use the exported (public) code elements in the other package. Package names and package import names shall also be identifiers.
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Although the code written in high-level programming languages is more understandable than low-level machine languages, we still need some comments for some code to explain the logic. The example program in the next section contains many comments.

A Simple Go Demo Program

<div class="tmd-usual">
Let's view a short Go demo program to know all kinds of code elements in Go.

About Line Breaks
</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="tmd-usual">
Like many other languages, Go also uses a pair of braces (<code class="tmd-code-span">{</code> and <code class="tmd-code-span">}</code>) to form an explicit code block. However, in Go programming, coding style can't be arbitrary. For example, many of the starting curly braces (<code class="tmd-code-span">{</code>) can't be put on the next line. If we modify the <code class="tmd-code-span">StatRandomNumbers</code> function declaration in the above program as the following, the program will fail to compile.
</div>
<p></p>
<pre class="tmd-code line-numbers">
<code class="language-go">func StatRandomNumbers(n int) (int, int)

Some programmers may not like the line break restrictions. But the restrictions have two benefits:

We can learn more about line break rules in <a href="line-break-rules.html">a later article</a>. At present, we should avoid putting a starting curly brace on a new line. In other words, generally, the first non-blank character of a code line should not be the starting curly brace character. (But, please remember, this is not a universal rule.)
