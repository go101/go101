<h1>Array values are compared element by element</h1>

<p>When comparing two array values, their elements will be compared one by one.
Once two corresponding elements are found unequal, the whole comparison stops and a false result is resulted. The whole comparison might also stop for a panic produced when comparing two interfaces.</p>

<p>For example, the first comparison in the following code results in false, but the second one causes a panic.</p>

<pre><code class="language-Go">package main

type T [2]interface{}

func main() {
	var a = T{1, func(){}}
	var b = T{2, func(){}}
	println(a == b) // false
	
	var c = T{2, func(){}}
	var d = T{2, func(){}}
	println(c == d) // panics
}
</code></pre>
