Run it on __ Go play`` https://go.dev/play/p/YimtmACsxOP __.

Key point:
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
* 
	The `r` variable declared in the inner block is not a re-declaration of the one (the return result) declared in the function top block.
	It is totally a new declared variable.
	So the return result is not modified in the inner block.
