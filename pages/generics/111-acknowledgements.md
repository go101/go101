# Acknowledgments

Firstly, thanks to the whole Go community. An active and responsive community guarantees the completion this book.

Specially, I want to give thanks to the following people who helped me understand some implementation details in the official standard compiler and runtime: Robert Griesemer, Ian Lance Taylor, Axel Wagner, Keith Randall, findleyr, Bob Glickstein, Jan Mercl, Brian Candler, Awad Diar, etc. I'm sorry if I forgot mentioning somebody in above lists. There are so many kind and creative gophers in the Go community that I must have missed out on someone.

I also would like to thank all gophers who ever made influences on the Go 101 book, be it directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally.

Thanks to Olexandr Shalakhin for the permission to use one of [the wonderful gopher icon designs](https://github.com/shalakhin/gophericons) as the cover image. And thanks to Renee French for designing [the lovely gopher cartoon character](https://reneefrench.blogspot.com/).
